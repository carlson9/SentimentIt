SentimentIT Summary
Our goal is to create an R package that interacts with the SentimentIt API. Our functions help 
automate many of the elements of the API so researchers can easily interact with the API through R. The basic functions 
do simple tasks like creating HITS, posting documents to the API, reading in data from the API, checking workers, and
revoking worker qualifications. These functions are then put into a series of wrappers which offer the user different
levels of automation. Some levels allow the user to time when batches are posted, and the final wrapper SentimentIt 
automates the entire process from start to finish.
