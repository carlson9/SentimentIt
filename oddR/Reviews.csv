Stars,Review1,"Boring. Terrible CGI, spinning camera during fight scenes which will make you dizzy and terrible jokes. Save yourself the pain and don't see it like I regretfully did."1,"really didn't like a single thing about it, which is a shame because the cast is great. I felt like it had no cohesion and was just all over the place."1,"Borat was a fluke, and Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of humor is only marginally better than Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The simplicity of the plot would be acceptable if the jokes that populated the movie were in any way funny, but they're not. They're terrible jokes that are so broad, it's insulting to think that anyone with half a brain would find them funny. This is the type of movie that where the world would be a better place had the money spent on this movie been spent on giving bottled water to needy people. This will be the last Sacha Baron Cohen movie that I will see in a theater. He, like Adam Sandler, is cinematic poison, and it's not worth anyone's time and energy to go to a movie theater and experience 90 minutes of rectum and genital jokes."1,"since 70% of all black children are fatherless i find this another black fallacy propaganda stunt foisted on the masses, for the sole reason of ignoring the facts of black life and culture."1,"A self-indulgent (and interminable) failure that has perhaps the worst use of 3D I have ever seen (it simply has no sense of depth and makes the film too dark), while the dialogue is infantile and awful, the actors are all terrible (Muyock is easily the worst) and it feels almost impossible to care about such a detestable protagonist."1,"The actors were brilliant and delivered brilliant performances in what I'm sorry to say, was a rather boring moment in movie history. Quite frankly, the story had no flow, was very predictable, but the lighting was good; sufficiently broody to qualify as a Blade Runner stepchild. ."1,"Easily one of the worst so-called movies I've ever encountered. Less than five minutes into this travesty, after seeing cheesy production values, horrible dialogue, and wooden acting, we see the colonel meeting up with the other ""officer,"" This senior officer, looking like a town drunk (slovenly, unkempt long hair, and with juvenile dialogue), proceeds to address the other fellow as lieutenant as he stares at the guy's captain bars. Five minutes was all I could endure and do avoid this waste of time."1,Another boring. amateurish movie.1,"I saw the first one twice. I began watching the second one before switching it off half-way through, then building up the courage to finish it a few days later. I managed this stupid bungle of a film in one sitting. I got what I probably deserved - copious amounts of gore, an unfathomable story and some terrible, terrible acting. I was somewhat impressed with Dieter Laser's performance in the original film, but he is easily the most exasperating aspect of this one - he seems to have confused shouting and bawling at the top of his lungs with acting. What seems really saddest of all though is that he, his co-stars and director Tom Six - who makes the most self-aggrandising cameo in cinema history - seem to genuinely believe that they are making a seriously important work of art. In actual fact, Final Sequence is one of the most grotesque works of alleged art in recent memory."1,"If I wanted to see a movie on making my own Delorean time-machine, I'd go to San Diego Comic Con. I wanted a ""making of"", and this was as far from it as you can get."1,"Not good, not even close."1,"A self-indulgent (and interminable) failure that has perhaps the worst use of 3D I have ever seen (it simply has no sense of depth and makes the film too dark), while the dialogue is infantile and awful, the actors are all terrible (Muyock is easily the worst) and it feels almost impossible to care about such a detestable protagonist."1,"A very, very dull love story drama with an unlikeable lead actor. At least some of the hardcore scenes are decent but uh.. there's other places to go for that kinda stuff."1,Thank you for the reminder of why I don't watch anything on CNN. What a moron narrator and a completely ignorant telling on so many levels.1,I'm so disappointed in Tina and Amy's choice in choosing these roles! Way too old for the characters they played!1,"This movie starts out pretty good, but even from the start, the relationship between Fanning's character and Gere's is strange. Gere's character acting is a bit over the top, even considering that the character is supposed to be very dramatic. After the tragedy, the relationships between the main characters is uncomfortable and 40 minutes into the movie, it devolves into an adult version of an after school special and I stopped caring about how it ended."1,To say that this is a huge disappointment would be an understatement. The entire film felt redundant. There was absolutely no real character development and hardly any characters at all. Even the returning characters somehow didn't even feel like characters at all. It felt rushed and forced. This could have been so much better.1,"This is as bad as movie making gets, poor cast, poor acting, poor script (in fact terrible script) poor score - I got halfway and realised I would never get those 45mins of my life back and became enraged at myself for firstly spending $6.99 on iTunes and wasting my hard earned in such a manner. If you're still thinking of watching this movie, clearly I'm not making it clear, THIS MOVIE IS SERIOUSLY CRAP. It stinks so bad it's like taking out the garbage and the plastic bags breaks all over you, it's like finding a toe nail cutting in your pasta, it's the nauseus feeling you have after eating a prawn that's been out in the sun too long. I'm having more fun right now writing this than watching it as it plays in the background. You get the gist - my advice...get a few extra hours sleep."1,Far too long and completely predictable.1,Strange. Didn't really do anything for me.1,"To be fair, I don't like Ettore Scola. I find him too politically correct and to be frank mushy. And this film is no exception: ""look how awful the awful fascists are and how wonderful the gay-freedom-loving-culture-buffs are"". No really you think so?Now Mastroianni and Loren are not bad actors, but they're not good enough that seeing them non-stop on the screen doesn't reveal their short-comings and cheap tricks.The only truly pleasant moment is in the very beginning when Italian newsreal of the time are presented: sheer madness! Hilarious in a crazy way."1,"Only a mad German could make a film about anarchic dwarfs. It's not a comfortable watch either, and has a nasty, macabre element. There's also cruelty to animals which I cannot stand. I respect Herzog for making it, but I never want to see it again."1,"My sincerest apologies to all my flixster buds who loved this one. Walter, I would like to add this baby to your burgeoning list of ""I could not sit through this"" movies. No kidding, Walter, I tried three times over three nights. Sorry, flixster friends. It must just be me."1,"i quit at about 38minutes... the chop style scene shifts, blatant studio sets vs. outdoor footage, and sitcom dialogue were worse enough to ruin any suspension of disbelief.. but then started the neanderthal philosophy of gender relations, and the lady's descriptions of her emotions during the paris romance, which was totally not what was happening during those scenes. what a load"1,Pretty lame you guys. Watch a better movie like contracted. It will have you on the edge of your toe nails from start to finish.1,"Sure, it's a cute movie, but nothing works. Everything is excruciating, even with Jon Voight's somewhat decent acting as a German villain. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen."1,"Criminally dishonest, Karla is basically the headlines shot with zero inspiration and acted on auto-pilot. There's nothing very scandalous in all of this, except, of course, the whole purpose of the damn film. It barely offers any insight on Bernardo and Homolka's psychology, and prefers to show us some sickeningly unecessary sexual torture scenes only to satisfy those who simply couldn't get enough of what they heard on television. Simply put, when a studio picks such a horrifying story and ends up having it filmed with such banality, both sides are downright wrong the result is a film that shouldn't exist, period."1,"You would think with the cast, this film would have some potential. WRONG.Â This movie just doesn't know what it wants to tell it's audience.Â Lights, Camera, ....What?"1,"Oh my Gosh, who made this awful film that surprisingly featured male frontal nudity and Simon actually died in real life? Pretty much a typical B-movie really, only watch it if you've got more spare time"1,Worst one of The Crow series I ever watched. Edward Furlong as the next Crow is average in his action sequences of this action-horror film.1,"What's beyond the Poseidon Adventure? Nonsense. Beyond the Poseidon Adventure is an unnecessary sequel with a stupid plot which wasted the talent a great cast and made them look terrible. The idea of getting in to see what's inside of a collapsing ship was preposterous; the first movie works because there are people trying to find a way out, doing the opposite is foolish. The only reason for making this picture was money, I can't find another valid explanation."1,"So bad it's almost good, but not quite."1,"Swinging with The Finkels is bad movie. If you go into the movie knowing that, then you'll be fine, but you will have get used to stupid jokes and awkward moments. Ever since I saw Tangled starring the beautiful and talented Mandy Moore and The Hobbit starring the always amazing Martin Freeman, I've been wanting to see this movie. Unfortunately, this movie left me wanting to see them in a more fantastical setting with a smarter script and decent director at least."1,"I stuck with this thinking surely the excitement will arrive soon. Unfortunately the most exciting scene happens in the first 5 minutes. It's all down hill from there. You watches flashes of light, the screen goes black and you glimpse a seal. Not even Halle berry in a bikini made this exciting. That's 2 hours I'll never get back!"1,"This awful mid budget horror feels like the worst ever episode of the ""X-Files"", a dated plot about a teen who gains evil powers by viewing some found footage. There are two movies within the movie but the quality is so bad overall that it's hard to distinguish any of them. Christian Slater looks relatively healthy again so his mum might like watching this, nobody else will."1,"Nothing to watch.. The script is too shallow, and nothing looks interesting in the stories of family members. Just I love the angles of the camera in some scenes. An hour & a half in vain.."1,"Forgeting the low quality of the animation, since it's a low budget movie, what is left itÂ´s no very good. The characters have barely any personality or development and the story it's unnecessary complicated"1,"I was curious when I saw the trailer for this movie. When I saw it, the only thing that got interesting, was the last 20 minutes. Apartment 143 is a boring horror film that didn't get me scared. The acting is dull, I just didn't care for the characters until we learn more about them when the last 20 minutes start, and there was a lot of plotholes which really bug me a lot. It's a movie filled with clichÃ©s that I seen before, and it's very forgettable."1,i can sum it all up in 5 letters... -> sucks from top to bottomâ€_1,"I'm not even sure why I try. I wouldn't have gotten this trash if it wasn't for my friend at the video store giving it to me for free because the original Zombie Diaries was a huge pile of shit. At least this one is a sliver of a better movie (it's hard to say that). This one deals with the military and very few civilian survivors left as the world has been overtaken by zombies. More zombies in this round but the acting could've been done better by my little neighborhood kids playing in the backyard. Overall, this is a second helping of shit pile from the first film."1,"HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! Mandy Moore's character literally made me wanna punch her through the screen... The only ""good"" thing about it is being able to look at Kellan Lutz. I was surprised and disappointed to find out Dermot Mulroney produced it... I love him but I think he should stick to acting."1,"Slow film - not worth the time. The music is pretty good, but otherwise it is a very slow and boring film"1,"Everyonce in while a great silly movie made for kids and adults that is entertianingly enjoyable comes along..then you stop. You do not try to recreate the magic in a silly sequel, like this movie. The actting was bad, the graphics were lame and the story line ..never mind. I liked Lost Boys..but this..I dont like."1,"The 1998 film The Prince of Egypt did better than this, and NOWHERE in the movie did it have talking animals--it didn't offend too many folks either. But this takes Babe and the Passion together and kills any hope of a faith-based movie in theaters anytime soon."1,"Wow, this movie is bad. Not bad in a ""Troll 2"" so bad it's good kind of way, but bad in a ""Gigli"" kind of way. Nick Swardson is usually hilarious and a real bright spot in Adam Sandler's movies, but here he is god awful. He stars as Bucky Larson an idiot from Iowa who finds out his parents used to be porn stars. Upon learning he decides it's his destiny to be in porn and moves to Hollywood to fulfill his dream. I think I may have chuckled once during this and it was at a Nick Turturro line. This is probably the worst Happy Madison movie ever. Worse than ""Jack and Jill"", ""Dickie Roberts"", ""Benchwarmers"", and anything with Rob Schneider. I don't know why I thought this would be ok(my hopes weren't high, but I expected to at least laugh some), but this is a big letdown. If your a Swardson fan, just pop in a dvd of his stand up instead. This is the kind of movie that could make him lose fans."1,"Follow up to the first film, pretty much the same plot, as a man tries to escape from a futuristic maximum security prison, this time orbiting way into space away from Earth. It's really quite dull, messy and campy."1,"The first Leprechaun was a bizarre affair of pure cheese that was bad, but mildly amusing. This sequel on the other hand was bad, purely bad. Trying to build on the previous film, to yet more mediocre results, Leprechaun 2 fails to deliver on good bits of comedy horror. The script is poorly written, the comedic delivery is lazy, and overall this is just a rehash of old ideas. Leprechaun is a prime example of a sequel that doesn't work, not to mention that like its predecessor, it's almost as bad. There's nothing satisfactory about this sequel. If you enjoy good, cheesy horror comedies, there are far better films than this one. The problem with the Leprechaun films is that it goes so over board, and a lot of it repeats itself it becomes almost a clichÃ©. The idea is amusing, but the execution is poor. I don't understand why they would make a sequel to a bad comedy horror flick. This sequel doesn't try anything new and it's tiresome, lazy and ridiculous like all the other films. Leprechaun 2 is at least not as bad as so many others in the series, but it still is pretty bad. Oh well, the filmmakers knew what they were doing in delivering a film series that would make them tons of money by constantly delivering garbage. The sequels were simply a way to make a quick buck, with no real script substance, character development or good directing. This is the first awful sequel to a terrible film. Don't expect anything good watching this."1,"I've always been an Eddie Murphy fan, but I must say, his movies lately have really stunk. ""A Thousand Words"" is the latest example of that, as this movie aims to be funny, sweet, and charming, and fails miserably. Murphy stars as Jack, a literary agent trying to sign a new age guru, Dr. Sinja(Cliff Curtis). Then a tree grows in Jack's front yard, and every time he speaks a leaf falls. Once all the leaves fall, the tree dies and so does Jack. Stupid? Very! Murphy tries to make the movie funny as he tries to communicate in weird ways. But, he never writes a note or sends a text message, something like this makes this movie with no logic, even more hard to believe. The acting is terrible as the supporting cast are all bad, and Murphy just looks like he is going through the motions and doesn't resemble the same guy he used to be. I'm all for comedians doing more family friendly movies, but at least make them entertaining. I doubt even kids like this movie. Heck, it has 0% on the rotten tomato meter. That alone should tell you to stay away, far away from this."1,"I didn't quite understand the plot, the action, or the title of this dull action flick, which seemed to have a derivative style."1,"If I did a ""Beowulf"" book report based on this Christopher Lambert film, I'd flunk."1,"There are a few funny moments here and there. Other than that, this is just another dumb stoner film, glorifying drugs. I can't believe that one of my favorite actors started out in this crap fest."1,"pretty terrible movie where everyone knows the movie is just a big joke so they all try to give the worst performance they can. whoever casted Eva Mendes in Hitch should have just watched this first and been like ""hmmm well Ms. Mendes, i see where youre coming from... but i gotta be honest. you are just AWFUL. sorry""..... anyway its kinda cool to see Alexis Arquette as a chick and then see this where he/she has like a goatee thing and what looks like the most obnoxiously 90's shirt ive ever seen"1,"I am not sure why I even spent the time to watch this movie, but I knew what I was getting into."1,i can't believe i'm giving such a low rating for a Newman- Woodward movie (especially Joanne was delightful). Was it a comedy though? It was a romantic nothing. A womanizing dick meets a dynamic tomboy who doesn't want to change but then she does and they fall in love.1,"OH MY GOD! This movie is so bad that it deserves to be likeable for laughing at. Matthew McConaughey digs an extremely large hole to die in in this film. He is one of the worst actors ever. He was funny in Fool's Gold, but then he went to bed. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen period. Damn I wish I could have seen this coming before I watched it! There is no reason why it should have been thought of!"1,"Well...um...I thought the score was great and they used a Cocteau Twins song so that was a plus but otherwise....Â Let me put it this way, I'm the first to admit that I didn't understand everything about Donnie Darko but the makers of this didnt know ANYthing about it.Â It's like they cobbled together the most memorable moments and ideas from the first and then threw in half-assed storylines about meteors with weird side effects, a bitchy friend and disappearing children (which is never even resolved!)Â Now just in case this all sounds like disappointment it's not because I went into this with an open mind but lower than low expectations and it still didnt come close to matching."1,"30 years on and we have a remake of the little known, but very weird film Long Weekend (1978). I saw the original when I was very young and at the end you just think WTF?! This is almost by the numbers remake, so I knew what was gong to happen, which effected my overall opinion. I remember the first being a lot more tense, scary and jumpy. This just didn't have the same impact. Check out the 78 version of you want some real creepy thrills!"1,"Uninventive, even Bettis' performance cannot save this film"1,Please stop....just stop.1,There goes the same worst ones again. The jokes are spread further apart and the quality of writing seems down. Many of our favorite characters from previous films were missing.1,"Caine was once asked if he had ever seen ""Jaws: The Revenge"" and famously replied ""No, but I've seen the house it built."" This truly is awful, opening with the killing of Sean Brody by yet another shark who seems somehow related to the original. Older brother Mike, now portrayed by Guest, seems to have aged backwards since the third movie and is working in the carribean with a crew of local stereotypes. Van Peebles terrible accent may have inspired Jar Jar Binks. The shark is clever enough to track down Mike but sadly not clever enough to finish him off, leaving it open for a sequel which thankfully never happened."1,"Not that I expected much from a movie about a chimpanzee that plays baseball, but it's pretty obvious that whoever wrote and produced this film was banking on Matt LeBlanc's popularity at the time to sell tickets. It certainly isn't because there's a plot... or any humor... or really much of anything besides a bunch of idiots chasing a monkey around for an hour and a half. I always wondered if I might be missing something really cute by not watching this movie, but now I see I definitely was not."1,"I swear I saw this movie several years ago and I thought I liked it, but watching it again today, I was like -- what was I thinking!? What a terrible waste of time. Yuck."1,I'm sorry this is just one of the worst movies of all time. Something about me doesn't want to watch a horrible plot and Willem Dafoe sing 'Singin in the Rain'. Terrible acting and an embarrassment to filmmaking. Easily the worst movie I've ever seen.1,Incredibly annoying zombie knock-off with third-rate direction and a fucking awful script. Not funny or scary. Skip.1,"Obviously by the sixth entry of a franchise, scriptwriters seem to be scratching at the bottom of the barrel. This is the case with the sixth entry of the Hellraiser Franchise. Hellseeker is a wasted opportunity and feels like a made for TV film. People say this is worth watching because it brings back Kristy, the main character from the first three Hellraiser films back into the fold. The problem is, she's only back, but briefly. She plays an important role in this film, and the story does focus on her character, but if she's so important to the overall storyline, why is she on screen for less than 10 minutes? What a waste. The acting is pretty bad, even by direct to video standards, and the dialogue seems fake, and the interaction between the characters doesn't feel right. Also a thing that bothered me, was the virtual absence of the Cenobites, Pinhead shows up 35 minutes in and has barely enough screen time. Hellseeker is a terrible sequel, and is a waste of celluloid. Everything about this film is bad, not even Doug Bradley or Ashley Laurence where able to save this dreadful film. Clive Barker should have put his foot down, because this film is a mockery of Clive Barker's original masterwork. What makes this more insulting is that on the back of the DVD, it says that this film is far better than the original, yeah right."1,"This film has horrible effects and doesn't even come close to the 1995 version. And what really bothers me is that the kid doesn't even get scared when he sees casper, he actually gets happy. That kid has some issues. Yeah it's not very good."1,"It doesn't make any sense at all, slightly funny, but weird. Easily Forgettable."1,Make no mistake...It's Pat is a terrible movie. The SNL stuff was funny and the concept is stretched as far as it goes but as big as a train wreck as this is...I kind of like it as being a mess. It's got bad jokes and has Ween in a bit part. This is almost like a cult as I know many women who love this but it is virtually stupid formula 1. setup of not knowing what sex Pat is. 2. Punchline. 3. Repeat over and over for the movie's duration. Add Dave Foley as another sexually confusing character and you've got something that is more stale than a rerun of SNL. At least it's funnier than SNL has been since the late 90's but that isn't saying anything at all.1,"I really enjoyed the original with Brooke Shields and yes it is on my movies that are very hard to find list, however deemed this sequel just ok. Somethings they should just leave as they are."1,Saw this once. That was enough.1,They took theses movie a little too far this time. Everything would have been fine if they left it alone with just the kids. I really can't believe that dogs have the ability for complex thoughts.1,omfg. what the hell was this. i didn't see the whole movie but i saw enough to confuse and anger me.1,This is the worst Police Academy series I ever saw that the ones who keep doing totally stupid things very loudly.1,This movie should never have been made in the first place. Elephant shit.1,"It's not all bad. There is one reason to recommend it. It's shorter than ""Double Team"", the movie that Dennis Rodman made with Jean-Claude Van Damme."1,"Sweet Jesus God Almighty, what have we here! Who in their right mind would even come close to imagining such an awful movie? What did the people involved with this film think they were doing? Were they even thinking at all? Were their careers in such bad shape that they needed for this movie to be made? And even then, don't they have any decency or moral fiber to speak of? God help them all!"1,"The only good things to come out of this movie are Sharon Stone, Leslie Easterbrook, and Corinne Bohrer, simply because they are eye candy thoughout the whole picture; even though they only have brief scenes/shots. Otherwise, this movie is just the same running jokes as the first two, with many repeated ""favorite"" lines."1,"Very limp and soppy romantic comedy about a couple wanting to have a baby, then breaking up in time after they can't have one then they meet other people and eventually after realising they do love each other they get back together again. I only saw this simply because it was a Wilder film and usually most of his films are good fun but this really is a film for the ladies haha not really funny, alittle slapstick here and there but mainly its a light hearted ladies flick about a young couple and their relationships with each other and others, more of a gentle drama directed by Leonard 'Mr Spock' Nimoy of all people!"1,disney originals are always best!!! i hate it when the older animated disney films get modern remakes like this. they always suck!!1,This was a piece of crapola. This was the worst sequel to a movie possible. It was soo dumb and had a horrible story to it. Shouldnt have even been made cause it was a disgrace to the original.1,Lousy sequal (if you can even call it that) that gives us an overly perfect Cinderella in three lousy stories that make me cringe even thinking of them. Not even a remote chance I will watch this one again.1,"Even in the world of merchandise tie-in animated movies, this Rainbow Brite outing is pretty terrible. One of the main points of the film revolves around the Big Bad tying a rope around a planet and towing it to her home with a spaceship. Yeah, okay. Then there are the unnecessary comic asides with two bumbling villains that don't work on any level. Over on the editing and scripting side, the action constantly shifts away from Rainbow Brite and her mission just to keep the ancillary characters fresh in the minds of the audience. Those minor scenes, though, last a whopping 30 to 45 seconds, never providing enough time for those sequences to do anything of importance. The end result is a film that goes beyond cheesy to so sugary sweet I wanted to get my teeth checked after watching it. Even other blatant money grabs of the decade like the Transformers and G.I. Joe movies included risk and, well, real world stakes. There's nothing like that here, if you include winter not being able to go away...and the people of Earth literally giving up because of the snow and grayness. Really?"1,Lauren Bacall looks lost in what might be her most useless appearance in a film and the rest of the cast can't rise above this crappy script.1,Christmas cinema at its very worst.1,"Geez, I love Roberto Benigni's work in Life is Beautiful and The Tiger and the Snow, but this movie adaptation was awful, like probably the worst adaptation of a beloved classic I've ever seen. I know good directors can make bad movies, but never would I thought it would be this bad. (except for when Ron Howard directed The Grinch)"1,"Benigni's follow up to the Oscar winner La Vita Ã© Bella is a disastrously expansive flick where everything is not measured well, everything is overwhelming and sometimes even laughable. Furthermore, Benigni as the young living marionette may have semed the right kind of bizarre casting a few years before the film was produced, but in 2002 it was already too late for him to play such a part."1,"Creepy, unfunny and just plain terrible."1,"""Homecoming""is a very good movie ... If you have nothing better to watch! After all what is the problem the characters and what is the problem of the actors and what terrible casting choice! Mischa Barton? Jessica Stroup? My God, what crap performances! Nothing convincing and mediocre! And the characters? How can anyone be so stupid as Elizabeth? Or so naive as Shelby? After all, did not realize that the villain hiding Elizabeth in her own home is asking to be arrested? Well, I can not criticize the characters because they do not exist, I have to blame is the direction, production, screenwriter ... By doing a story and totally incoherent gibberish that is! I feel the humiliation, but it's the truth! This movie sucks!"1,"Really, really, really bad film making. The film is of a poor quality rarely seen. The director does not seem to realize that a scene can change without requiring an establishing shot -- actually, virtually the same establishing shot every time, showing the steeple of a church -- which is completely unnecessary because the ENTIRE STORY happens in the same monastery, so no one in the audience is likely to be asking, ""Where are they now?"" The makeup and special effects (i.e., ""blood"") look like things my sister and I did at Halloween when we were 10 years old. The acting? -- someone really raised the dead to cast this horror flick! Nevertheless, the story was slightly coherent and diverting, saving the film from a 1/2 star rating."1,"This film makes no sense. I'll give it one star for the sniffing, because that was seriously creepy."1,"And on the topic of ""horror movies that don't contribute much in any sense""...Â I really cannot think of anything constructive or interesting to say about Rest Stop. It's dull and the ending is infuriating. My friends and I had more fun discussing the heroine's big chin instead of anything the movie itself had to offer. No scares, no tension, not even any horror movie schadenfreude. This is a total waste of time."1,It's as bad as you've heard.1,It's one of those that is exactly what it looks like. Enjoyable wee-hours-of-the-night viewing.1,For the life of me I really really cant get myself to like this movie as much as other people do. Sebastian irritates me to bits.1,"A sports team packed with lovable misfits overcomes wacky antics, random problems and extreme adversity and somehow manages to defeat the top team in the league. Plot of every sports movie? Yeah, pretty much. The Big Green is an exercise in numbing ineptness."1,"Plot of every sports movie? Yeah, pretty much. The Big Green is an exercise in numbing ineptness."1,OMG this is forgettable.1,This movie sucked...........................1,"The only thing remotely funny about this is the way the actor who plays dumb Rick says the name Carl.... very good imitation of Andrew Lincoln. Tired jokes, bad acting and awful make up effects on the walkers.... Spoofs are getting very lazy nowadays...."2,"You can see they tried to make an epic movie. But it lacks direction, it drags on for too long and it doesn't keep gettin' any better as the movie goes on."2,"Although it's been advertised as a comedy...it is not. It has a few funny moments, but if you're looking for Tina Fey ""funny"" skip it. It's a good story based on a war correspondence life in Afghanistan."2,"Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets - mirroring our own society wouldn't you know - the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes - breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive - are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short."2,"Disappointing. Big problems with the plot and the boy Christ was badly caste. Other actors were very good, but the weak plot points just kept the movie coming together for me. Didn't care for the role of the ""devil"" but it could have been used to firm up the seemingly unreasonable motivation of key characters such as Herod Antipas, but wasn't. Script was boring in many parts but my biggest criticism is the lack of humor. Why portray the young Christ as ""troubled?"""2,"What makes this series so tough to watch is not only the shakiness of the entire premise of genetically-predetermined factions, but the blandness of the characters that populate this world. In this third installment, there is no character development and villains with the most laughable of intentions. We are meant to sympathize with Tris, but her character is so underwhelming in ""Allegiant,"" you can't help but shrug your shoulders at whatever happens to her or Four."2,A great cast and great concept with a disappointing execution. The whole movie felt awkward and flowed slowly.2,"I really like some of the imagery that director Bruce McDonald uses in his Halloween themed horror flick ""Hellions"". They set a good mood for the atmospheric shots. I just didn't care for the overall story much. Maybe next time the ddirector will be able to combine the two elements into a really good movie."2,Too melodramatic for my taste. The gravity defying stunts too false probably the rage in asia.2,"Energetic beginning and really sweet ending and a bore and obvious cliche center in this laugh free comedy that tries to be funny and lectures in one's self with a thin papered obnoxious supporting cast aside from Kevin Dunn. I did not laugh once and just watched this. Tackling on a premise I have seen in the 40 Year Old Virgin or Adventureland, a film that was actually funny, our two main characters Anne and Jeff try grow and change their personality with Anne turning into an alcoholic turrets girl and Jeff transforming into a douche after knocking a douche. Every other character is caricature of a stereotype from the nerds to the blond brainless female talking about her profile pic. I could not help, but to jeer at the middle which is a shame after laugh free, but charismatic opening."2,"In its favor, the film is shot with a dreamlike atmosphere reminiscent of Terrence Malick. The problem is that the story never makes much sense and is too esoteric that it really doesn't connect with anyone."2,"Meandering and uneventful, just like that, another interesting premise gone to waste. Nice performances though."2,"The movie doesn't have much to offer besides the ending performance which is emotionally charged. I watched the movie expecting some great Choreography moves but was disappointed in that department. The movie only digs into the present day Iran situation for personal melodrama which was kind of boring. Either they should have focused on the dancing or the Iran situation, frankly Afshin Ghaffarian life is not dramatic enough to be made into a movie"2,"Didn't make it through this one. Absolutely love the book but this translation feels wooden. Ironically, the animation is really wooden too. Disappointing."2,"The Square takes a look at the civil unrest that effected Egypt during 2013. While much of the documentary is slow their are moments of tense confrontation that make the viewer feel as if they are with the protesters at the square. The Square though honorable in its efforts fails to really trap the viewer with its message of freedom and revolution as it becomes tedious and quite boring. Questions are posed and answered....answered,,,,answered,,,and answered again. In more capable hands The Square might have been an eye opening documentary that would trap the viewer instead I fought to keep my eyes open."2,What is possibly a thoughtful social commentary on urban youth crime and skewed moral priorities in respectable households is severely impaired by a very sudden ambiguous ending.2,"Now and then it does offer some insight into the country's social inequality and police brutality, but as a whole this is a cheap fantasy filled with nonsense (like a villain that seems more like a psychic) and naive optimism to make poor people believe that it is easy to have a happy ending."2,"OK, let me just begin by saying I love the gorgeous, adorable, sexy Alice Eve and the charming, handsome Chris Evans (Hey, he's Captain America. Growing up, I WAS Captain America, or at least I thought so). But that's where the accolades end.Â This one appeared to be of a contract-obligation nature for the duo, or maybe because it's an actor's movie, the stars felt it was a go. But I guess if you like ninety minutes of conversation between two people, (ENDLESS conversation) then this movie is for you.Â Let me sum it up for you, and you tell me if you've seen this one before. Guy randomly meets trouble gal. She's wary of him. He slowly but surely endears himself to her (in Hollywood-script-only fashion) as he ends up spending an entire day with someone he just met. They both have relationship problems, realize they aren't going to have the dream they imagined, fall in love and find that dream fulfilled, maybe, for we only see the first day, so who knows?Â There's a lot of cliche relationship-falling-apart dialogue, shrugging of shoulders, heartfelt smiles and honest moments. Yes, it's the romantic movie you've seen dozens of times before but only SO much better. Hey, and I was puling for the kids. But little under an hour in, I was fast-forwarding. And guess what? when I stopped I hadn't missed anything. You get the picture."2,"His personal story is not interesting at all, taking time from the bigger issue to be discussed. The audiovisual lenguage is very poor and the topic and cientific approach is very superficial in the way they handle different definitions of gender/discrimination/sexual differences. With more investigation it would have been more constructive to the audience."2,"A plane crashes leaving a group of American soccer players stranded on a deserted tropical island. The attractivr cast clash with each other for control while wearing very little, making the audience feel fortunate that it wasn't a plane full of overeaters anonymous that crash landed. The script is so overdone while still being underwritten. It looks more like a Chippendales calander shoot than survivors trying find ways to live."2,"A young woman directionlessly and disaffectedly spends a summer. Quebec has made one of the ""most French"" movies I have ever seen. Long shots, subtext-driven scenes, disaffected characters, existential angst - all the trappings are there, and yet even the most inaccessible of French cinema has an energy that's missing from Tu Dors Nicole. Overall, it's so subtle and pretentious that it will probably win an Oscar."2,"A mediocre fandom documentary, even when it wants to be something more. Sadly, ""Back in Time"" is a horrible mish-mash of production history and modern day impact that never comes to a confluence. It fails to be a nice making-of documentary and it also fails to really delve deeply into the fandom and the film's overall impact. Instead we learn about penning the script, a few minutes about it's influence on ""Rick & Morty"", and then back to bringing the script to the producers. With a better timeline and editing prowess it could have been a quaint adventure through time, but instead we are left with bits and pieces of DeLorean stuck somewhere in the middle of nowhere."2,"Not much of a story, ran out of ideas for a sequel, but cute nonetheless."2,An uninteresting romance that relies on the drawn out longing looks of the actresses to get the emotion across.2,"Monstrously stupid. Despite high production values, very nice costumes and a genuinely good performance by Radcliffe, this creature never should have been brought to life."2,"I'm torn on this one. Beautiful formalism, shot composition, good blend of still and mobile camera, pretty darn good unprofessional cast. Yet the central gimmick is more effective at alienating the viewer than re-framing our perspectives. I'm not convinced the form fits the function here."2,"Like its central character, The Benefactor is lost by giving a little of too many things. It has an intriguing premise with a handful of great actors to deliver the story. Yet, it just keeps teasing and the core issue is never dealt with handsomely."2,"For a horror film with an hour of build-up, there's a lot of talking and little tension. Prepare yourself for a lot of contrivances and plot holes, along with characters who behave in wholly unrealistic ways. While there is a cool third-act twist and the language barrier is leveraged in interesting ways, these aren't enough to off-set a film with no unique voices and a lot of expository dialogue."2,"hmmm...nothing special to see here...no real cohesiveness of the characters....beauty of Italian countryside is there, but it could be more.... too many cliches and it ends up the way you expect it..."2,"Fascinating concept, but I feel like there was a little left out of the middle. I also really wanted to know about the resolution of one of the characters that dropped off the map towards the end. The movie made interesting choices though and definitely makes you think twice about how invasive tech really is."2,"This is what happens when people are so attached to the importance of a story that the telling of the story itself suffers. This movie is too long, too melodramatic, and made with only one purpose: to gain attention for its own sake. The movie is so inflated with its own IMPORTANCE! and Eddie Redmayne's ACTING! that it comes off as an exercise in arthouse film predictability."2,"While it is a courageous act of filmmaking (Jafar Panahi smuggled this movie out of the country while on a 20-year ban from making one), this Golden Bear winner at the 65th Berlin Film Festival resembles an amateurish effort from a film student. The slices of contemporary Iranian lives are stitched together with gapping unrealism and the constant reference to the director's own filmography is suspicious of self-importance."2,"I hate to make a comparison but the documentary ""McConkey"" pretty much blows this documentary out of the water. How many times can you watch the same boring couple jump off something in the same way which involves very little skill (but like Russian Roulette takes a lot of nerve and little sense). Carl's wife seemed emotionally disconnected and unconvincing at selling BASE jumping as a life altering experience and using the old adage's of ""he died doing what he loved"" and ""we knew the risks involved"" in a cold monotone voice. Anyhow watch the documentary ""McConkey"" after you watch this and you'll understand my two-star review."2,"There is lots of sword fighting action in this one, which felt very long and drawn out. The direction of the action sequences felt very flat an unexciting. For 1950 it's an achievement, but the beauty of the Island isn't fully exploited. I've gotta say this is still the definitive pirate adventure for young boys everywhere to watch; they ought to show it in schools. I was put off by the bug-eyed accented performance of Robert Newton as Long John Silver, with every line being delivered in corny fashion; but kids might really like that."2,"Henry VIII is an interesting historical character.His Private life is the most fascinating part about him. For these reasons I'm shocked that The Private Life of Henry VIII was as boring as it was. And this was after watching Wedding Rehearsal. I understand this was back in the 1930s, but I would've wished for the film to be more risky. It was just a regular historical movie that one would watch ten minutes of in a history class. The scenery worked well, but nothing this film could do was enough to draw me in. Charles Laughton was a perfect Henry VIII to be fair, and despite only seeing a couple of his works, his becoming a favorite actor of the era."2,"I thought it was pretty dull to be honest. I thought it was meant to be just sci-fi, but it turned out it was a sci-fi comedy, which usually don't work. And it didn't. It wasn't funny, and it was just boring."2,"A good plot, but the film felt somewhat dated. One of the cornerstones of the modern gangster genre."2,So I watched this on my laptop and not at the Ziegfield. Bad move. Still... I think I can pretty confidently say - I did not enjoy this very unique but totally aimless film. The pleasures of M. Hulot elude me once again. Zut!2,"The problem is with Robert Williams' character - he's a complete asshole, and more importantly, wrong. We're supposed to be on his side, but he just acts like a complete jackass, especially to Jean Harlow, who doesn't really do anything wrong. Basically the movie tells us the rich people are terrible because they are rich, and not for any better reason than that, really. Instead, Williams' character just sulks and whines the WHOLE movie, about really trivial stuff, especially considering the movie takes place during the Depression. The character needs to grow up and get over his fragile male ego. Hard to believe this is a Frank Capra movie. I guess the movie is just horribly dated."2,"This film is exactly why I don't like independent films. The director focuses more on the so-called ""aesthetic"" details of the film and they consume all aspects of it. He stuffed SO MUCH SYMBOLISM about how pure Mui was he practically beat us over the head with it. The characters are flat and ugly and speak maybe 1/8 of the time. I hated the music - it was SO repetitive and I was really glad when the dad ran away so I wouldn't have to listen to him strum on his stupid qin again. I'm being nice by giving it two stars because I liked the one scene where Mui cracks open the papaya and touches the seeds. Otherwise, blegh."2,"What a shitty ending, Although the movies desetve its credits, this is not enough for the disappointing finalle. Watch it, but be prepare for the final opinion!"2,What a boring film! Although I think its was a good effort on behalf of the cast I was really counting the minutes for it to finish.2,"Remade as an action film called ""Gladiator"". This one was a historical epic piece of cinema, with slightly cheesy production values."2,"Another disappointment! I seem to be on a run recently of overrated films. The film of course isn?t all bad, I like the actual storyline and it?s bravery of using a child killer in it?s time, the beginning was good and so was the end, but slumped far too much in the middle.Â I can see why it?s a popular choice with people, but found parts far too boring."2,"A young woman falls for a man during her vacation in Italy, but social pressures and his passionate nature make a fop the more socially acceptable choice. Daniel Day-Lewis can play tough, gruff, evil characters like Bill the Butcher and Daniel Plainview and even the sexually voracious Tomas, but can he play an upper-class fop? Yes, he can. The man's range is extraordinary. This film is everything that is good and bad about a Merchant/Ivory production. It's opulent, classic, and essentially British, but it's also occasionally boring, making the most of the most trifling conflicts. Part of this is film's inability as a medium to make compelling commonplace disagreements in a way that is unique to books, but Ivory's direction, distant shots of four or more characters, accentuates the germane nature of the film's tiny conflicts -- about a room with a view, the settling of accounts, and a writer's fictionalizing of a character's dalliance. Overall, if you like Merchant/Ivory films, then you've probably already seen this one, and if you don't, this isn't much different from the rest."2,Very good acting and entertaining BUT this movie was not real enough or explicit enough for being based on real sickening events.2,"Pointless and boring movie, unappealing characters, slow and uneventful. Fails to involve the audience, poorly directed. Boring."2,"A very cheesy typical low budget 80's slasher film. It starts poorly, the acting is pretty terrible. However once we get to the creepy school reunion at night it becomes more interesting. It definitely has some aspects to it that slasher fans will appreciate. The run down deserted school does look spooky, bad lighting helps this. The kills are quite inventive for the time and gory to. The killers mask was also a good choice. One for slasher fans to seek out if you haven't seen it yet. Maybe if this got a better budget remake, or with a similar story it could do well!"2,"A hard movie to rate. It's very obviously shit. Anyone can tell you that much. Just look at that cover. Despite it's poor quality it at least tries to be a bit different and give The Crow a bit more depth. First of all the large gothic city setting is long gone. Now it is set in a small town with skyscrapers replaced by deserted landscapes. It's interesting at first, seeing such a bright Crow film. Then it just becomes confusing. I understand that in the first Crow film Brandon Lee's character was in a rock band. His image suited his persona before his death. Edward Furlong walks around looking very out of place and it's just peculiar. The film gives us a whole 30 minutes to get to know our future crow before his inevitable death. Good idea. The previous films chucked us straight into the action. It gives Furlongs later lust for revenge more weight and understanding. Unfortunately before this was a bizarre introduction to the bad guys. Freeze frames, corny names, it was like some kind of western B-movie. The performances barely deserve a mention apart from Dennis Hopper. He shows up in some club talking like a stereotypical black man. Apparently Satan is the original gangster or something. It was hilarious and embarrassing. Macy Gray was there too. Reading that back it sounds like some twisted dream. The Crow - Wicked Prayer is pretty similar to a joke about somebody you respect that has just died. It may be fairly chucklesome, but it is in poor taste. After thinking about it, it's simply insulting."2,"A dimwitted action sequel to a dimwitted disaster movie populated with a second string cast of TV movie stalwarts, and Michael Caine slumming it in a similar vein to Jaws:The Revenge. But like that film, it is still strangely watchable in a laugh at it rather than with it kind of way..."2,"Well it's not as good as the first I'm afraid, good to see Andrew Divoff back again as I think it was a new actor for the 3rd and 4th films. He hams up the Djin rather well, but the deaths are not as inventive as the first. I didn't think it was quite as gory as the first and it didn't have the dark humour of the first either. If you liked the first you might enjoy this, it just doesn't reach the heights of the first."2,"Can't believe I sat through this, nearly gave up on it very early on.Â Melissa George is especially horrid in this one. Lost half a star for the scene of her with her breast pump. Character is also crude, vulgar and repellant.Â Mandy Moore fares a little better, but she and the husband have zero chemistry. He looks like her father in the flashbacks of them dating.Â And wouldn't you know it, my all time ""favourite"" happy ending in the movie. That one never gets old."2,"hardly any action, dull, boring, the action pretty much happens at the beginning and the end of the movie.."2,"This looks like more of an audition for future actors than a complete movie in itself. With the exception of Christian Slater in a nondescript role as a pedophile cop, the young cast seems to be trying to figure out how to act in a horror flick. The story, loosely constructed as it is, seems like an afterthought. The idea is interesting though unoriginal; the transmission of an evil spirit via motion pictures. The execution of this is iffy throughout, though, and the gaping plot hole of how the villain can take over people's minds also seems tacked on to provide action and gore possibilities. Forgettable stuff that almost nobody will play back more than once. Probably best considered a casting call for a group of novice actors. A few good moments of tension keep it from falling completely flat."2,"Apartment 143 encompasses everything that's wrong with the mockumentary genre. It's simply used as a gimmick, and to no real effect. On the contrary, the shaky camera work and erratic editing is distracting. The script is full of cliches and no real surprises are to be found. The scares are mostly poorly timed and ill-executed. The film does some interesting things with the story, with its examination of psychokinesis, but that is ultimately undone by the ineffectual ending. An overall lackluster effort."2,Watching this movie will be sure to turn you into a zombie.2,"What to say about a movie where story is about a marriage counsellor who cannot manage to save a marriage...???? A movie that starts off with a wedding is usually going to see things go bad before they get better. Defying this common wisdom, ""Love Wedding Marriage"" never gets better! Ava (Mandy Moore) is a marriage counsellor whose life as a newlywed married to Charlie (Kellan Lutz) is turned upside down when she discovers her parents' happy marriage is unexpectedly headed for divorce. Determined to reconcile her parents for their 30th anniversary surprise party she stops at nothing plunging from one compromising situation to another. In that process she destroys her own marriage...Â Dermot Mulroney's directorial debut is a real flop and he made a chemistry-free romantic comedy with no power behind it... Mandy Moore and Kellan Lutz were good ""tools"" for that!"2,"Just ok, this is one of those movies that you watch when you have nothing better to do. The dvd cover looks more interesting that what the movie really was. I didnt see no helicopters, nor soldiers like on the cover. Funny to see these so-call Mercenaries go behind ememy lines with full backpacks and bedrolls. Thru out the whole movie they just would not let go of those bedrolls and even died with them on. Plus Billy Zane wasnt a major player in this movie. The CG effects when someone got shot and the ""red"" puff of smoke was kind of cheesy."2,Steve Guttenberg is getting too old to play the lead in a romantic comedy like this. The story was not even that well thought out as it was not even remotely realistic. Who is their right mind would just randomly stay at someone's house because their ex died and you had met once before? It's super strange and not even the side story of his writings makes it make any sense.2,"Disappointing. Good actors, but it fell short."2,"Better then the last one but still poor in quality to the first movie.Because its a STV fare it's just missing all the values that made the first one a classic.There is a couple of nice moments and you don't feel you are wasting you life away when watching it with a brief 81 mins running time, Nice to see Corey Feldman back but he lacks spark to he's role.lets just hope this is the last one in the series.............Please!!!"2,Pretty bad.2,Longer than it should have been the story-line was pretty dull and not that interesting.... the acting was good and i liked the ending.. but overall not really worth watching.2,Last time I saw this it was pretty terrible but I watched this a lot as a kid. The original is somewhat classic and I like how they got John Ratzenberger to try and get the Cheers element that they had going on with the first with George Wendt.2,"Better than the first. The humour is rather immature and lazy, but carried by Warwick Davis it is rather endearing. Fun to imagine Wicket going around and killing people. The acting is better, emotions range from scared to distraught. In a bigger setting and set on St. Patrick's Day the film has more to do and there are some great moments. Such as the drinking contest. Would we ever see Krueger, Myers or Leathface engage in a drinking contest? I doubt it. Not to mention Davis is cheered on by a group of ""wee people"" that chant ""One of us"". It's a more enjoyable film and one that overstretch it's reach."2,Eddie Murphy. What happened to your taste in movie roles? This was the stupidest movie..not funny at all. Just stupid.2,"Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu chase each other through a hail of bullets, broken glass and pointless explosions in this borderline nonsensical action flick. I literally cannot even attempt a synopsis of the plot because it makes so little sense! The characters are all cardboard cut-outs spouting action cliches and Ray Park is quite possibly the least charismatic villain I have ever seen. The fight choreography is clumsy and the constant stream of irrelevant stunts start to look plain silly after a while because there's so little plot to hang them on. If it weren't for the star names attached to it, this soulless and mechanical firework display would have struggled to make a straight to DVD release and is little better or intelligent than your average Van Damme debacle. If watching cars fly through the air and spontaneously explode for no reason to bad techno music is enough for you, then it may be worth 90 minutes of your time. If you need a coherent plot or remotely interesting characters, forget it."2,"This is such a stupid movie. Everything from the weapons used and the acting is funny. What makes it funny is that all the actors seem to be taking it so seriously. I would suggest not watching it, I wouldn't have if it wasn't on cable."2,National Lampoon ran out of theatrical steam by this point but the Kevin McDonald subplot and Matt Frewer's authority figure work. Mostly stupid gags but some actually work. I recall a few hot women in the cast as well.2,Disappointing movie. Some quirky moments in an otherwise boring movie.2,"I liked the original, as well as the short story it came from. I can't recall if I saw the sequel, which could go much towards what I thought of it if I did. I'll try to hit the positives instead of dwelling on the negative, which are many. The effects are okay. Eva Mendes looks great. And there you have it :)"2,Ok hear we go people say in there reviews if you watch this your an idiot but i gather the people who said it watched it there for you are idiots. Now people say this is vile and bad but i think diffirent Renne Taylor played in the nanny what can be described as a sex crazed old woman and in this film she is the same only thing is you see rather than hear talking about it. like ib the nanny she will talk about having sex in this you see it althought most people hate this film i think it is ok but could of been better a lot better.Â Best and Funny Scean at the end were she is dancing for the priest and pops the bloonÂ Worst Scean at the start were he pull the girls prostic arm off2,"A down-and-out reporter and a fashion designer fall in love in Paris. Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward's excuse to be together while working is a costume drama, except there's very little drama. It's more like a costume/farce. The rather contrived situations are interrupted by dumb special effects/schtick, and there's almost no character development. Even though Edith Head's costumes are great to look at and Newman and Woodward occasionally have the type of chemistry that only an off-screen husband and wife can convey on film, the film ultimately fails. What is more, films always uphold or reject a certain set of values, and in this case, women are supposed to be virgins who don't work or have any will that isn't subservient to a man. Woodward's character, Sam, is a successful working woman, but in order to woo Steve she puts on the guise of a socialite/prostitute. Think the reverse of As You Like It. Over the course of the film, Sam insists on being called Samantha, and she incurs Steve's wrath for her whore act. Meanwhile, Steve philanders like the last of the red hot lovers, and there is very little comment, as though such behavior is not only accepted but encouraged. The film's conclusion reveals its morality: though made in 1963, the roles of women in this film are stuck in the 50s. Overall, this is another great example for someone looking to write a feminist critique against a movie."2,The movie keeps you watching. But it is a poor version of eagle eyes. The ending on how they stopped echelon was awful.2,"Wow, this movie was shockingly boring. I was expecting a fun movie, but realized pretty fast that it wasn't. Boring and predictable."2,"Dumb unbelievable disaster movie from the end of that cycle that inexplicably stars some of the biggest stars of the 70's. Everybody seems pretty disengaged and it's sad to see William Holden once so vital and charismatic a burnt out shell, alcoholic and rather haunted. The special effects are laughably bad and the whole thing moves at a snail's pace."2,"It's not as bad as you may think. It's just utterly pointless. Essentially what the filmmakers have done is tell almost an identical story to Donnie Darko, just with Donnie's sister as the main character. If you understand Richard Kelly's time travel talk, then the big twist in this movie is that Samantha is not the Living Receiver, like Donnie was. She plays the role of the Manipulated Dead, or the role of Frank the bunny from the first film.Â It's a well made film. And Ed Westwick pretty much plays his Gossip Girl character here, which is always entertaining. But the film takes no risks. The filmmakers seem too concerned with making their film feel like Donnie Darko, that they don't explore the mythology in any way. The film is too safe, and as a result, is as forgettable as a bad meal."2,The original is way better.2,"Tries desperately to be a quirky indie drama, but all the oddball characters and twee songs in the world can't save this dull and mostly pointless mess. Only diehard fans of Jessica Alba should try sitting through this, and trust me, it's still going to be tough."2,I dont know why i insist on watching horrors as usual its not scary the storyline is crap and theres no real reason or point to the story so not worth the time and effect!!2,"Could have been a decent b-grade psycho movie, instead was stupidly confusing and in the end couldn't even figure out who the bad guy was!"2,"Interesting enough concept. Don't think that the writing, acting or editing was good enough to hold this movie together. I really didn't even find any of the characters interesting. Sorry, was funny at times but not enough to hold my attention."2,"It looks really dumb. If you made it to part 7, the only reward you get is knowing that the series only gets worse. Alot of the classic cast is missing and the remaining cast cannot pull this one together."2,"One thing you notice about this movie is the abundant reliance on those one note characters. Matt McCoy gives up on being a Guttenberg replacement and is now left as an actual serious cop. He isn't a lot of fun, as everyone around him is quirky or funny."2,"So what we have here is the story of a fish (which by now dwarves most whales) that can track individuals half way around the globe to extract it's ""revenge"" on them for what, being in the vicinity of a couple of its piscine mates being blown up/electrocuted?? I once saw a stand-up comedian devoting his entire routine to taking the piss out of this film...unintentionally hilarious!!"2,"Ed is not a bad family movie. If you have little kids or are just really bored and are looking for a quick laugh this movie may do it for you.Â The lines are cheesy, the plot is even cheesier, and it's more then unrealistic. But it does deliver some funny parts as a man embraces a Chimpanzee as not only a teammate but as a new best friend."2,Oh gosh. Pretty bad. Nuff said.2,"Third entry in the Critters franchise and it's clear right from the opening minutes, that the filmmakers have run out of ideas. Critters 3 is notable for being the acting debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. By this time, the third entry has become stale, uninspired drivel, and the fun from the first two films is replaced by a very mediocre script that recycled ideas from the first film, and has nothing new to offer the series. The acting is awful and the film is poorly constructed. The film fails at capturing the classic elements of the first two, and ends up being a tired effort that is simply boring, doesn't have anything going for it. The film could have been much better, but it doesn't, this third entry along with the fourth film are forgettable entries in the franchise that have nothing interesting to offer the series. This could have been an interesting third film, but it's obvious that all the good ideas have been used and the filmmakers were struggling to come up with something good for a third film, unfortunately, the film didn't work and it ends up being a bad one at that."2,"Return of the Living Dead Part II isn't so much a sequel as it's a remake. Once again barrels of Trioxin are discovered and opened in a small community, resulting in the reanimation of the dead. The plot hits the same beats and recreates some of the same scenes of the original, only in slightly different ways. The tone however, is way too jokey and slapstickish. Some of it's funny (if for no other reason than how crazy it is), but most of it's idiotic schlock. Missing the darkness and clever satire of the original, Return of the Living Dead Part II is uninspired tripe."2,Takes more of a watered down Jacob's Ladder approach and the Cenobites are rarely seen. Quite possibly one of the most predictable endings ever.2,I am pretty sure that at some point I watched this. I really loved all the Casper movies was I was a kid.2,"Not one of Pauly Shore?s best?it had its funny moments, but also had some very dumb ones and forced me to pass out during the first viewing. I finished it the next day, but I can?t say I am glad I did."2,"This comedy is only occasionally amusing, even with a rather fine cast. It's a shame, a lot of talent is wasted here. Most of the blame for it not working is the writing, it just isn't very well written."2,"This movie is just as outrageous and creepy as the SNL skits that spawned it, well maybe even more creepy. I didn't find Pat very funny on the show, and if you didn't either, I would not recommend this movie."2,"This was really quite atrocious. It seemed to start off okay for a bad follow on to a movie that was probably ill advised to start with. But the minute the kids grew up and became Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause, it was all over. (Admittedly Brian Krause is not that bad, and may even be a slight improvement on the original star, but that's not saying a whole lot).Â The story totally lost the suspense the original had about who was on the other side of the island, the story is jumbled and unconvincing and don't even get me started on the ""bad guys"" who may or may not have been intended to be Australian. (As the film was shot here and i could clearly hear the accents, though they were trying not to sound it... I think) Big mess of a film. Milla can't act at all. If you really have to, watch the original instead."2,The Bad News Bears strike out in their third movie. It's terrible and insulting to fans of the series.2,The worst of the Bears movies .... not even Kelly Leak was cool!!2,"I was not so sure about a third round of this franchise but I admit that it was a step up from the less than likable second movie. This time the kids are grown up and can talk and the dogs are doing the talking. It sounds like a bad idea but it worked well enough. The talking dogs were not bad, in fact, they were the best part of the movie. The Christmas spirit helps a little, but I thought the holiday angle should have a stronger impact on the plot than it did. John Travolta and Kristy Alley thankfully dial it back from their earlier performances and are tolerable this time around. Travolta has a new job and his new wealthy young boss is set on luring him into an affair. This part of the story is acceptable but it is highly predictable and sort of detracts from the dogs and their relation to the family. Where it is fails the worst is the cheesiness. It does not have enough heart, Christmas sprit, or laughs to give it a memorable identity, but this has been a problem for the whole series."2,"Not-so-fun in the sun. Being the fourth sequel in the series, it's not surprising this lacks the ingredients that made the first few films so funny. The script is a mess, the bad guys really corny and like something out of a second-rate Disney movie. Sure, it could be worse, but it's so obviously a product made just to cash in on its name. And you know it's a bad sign when a B-movie star like Steve Guttenberg declined to be in it. I'm gonna watch the last two as well, just to have seen them. But considering the state of this one, it'll be a miracle if I don't end up with any scars on my soul."2,"The one with the boats, is about all I remember. Wayne Gretzsky's wife was in it too. There's some busty babes to be seen, and some of the familiar Police Academy wont-go-aways as well. The new setting took it off the streets to the beach. Forgettable I'd say."2,"Jim Drake Jr. directs this cilly citizen patrol saga where the stars from the first flick train common folks. Better than the last one, but that isn't saying much."3,"What starts out as a promising study of a complex character unfortunately slowly morphs into a moving, though nonetheless surprisingly conventional, occasionally ambiguous, tearjerker. Despite excellent performances by Christopher Abbott and, especially, Cynthia Nixon, the film has little to offer in the way of originality or insight. Regrettably, this is likely to leave a lot of viewers either disappointed or wondering exactly what the director was trying to say."3,"Solid Acting. Predicable Result. Heard a lot of hype about this flick, and that may have ruined it for me. It was a good movie, stayed true to the Rocky franchise, but just didn't pack enough of a modern-day punch for me to remain interested."3,"A typical boxing story, nothing more than that. The fluid camera work during the fights feels very intuitive. You really feel like you're in the fight. The romance between the main character and the obligatory girl feels pushed and unnecessary."3,"Not the comedy the trailers, or the presence of Tina Fey, would lead you to believe, but definitely some laugh out loud moments, as well as intense, if not misplaced, battle sequences. Though those moments are hampered by forced tug-at-your-heartstrings moments, cliche romances and rivalries and yet another British actor in Alfred Molina cast as a Middle Eastern character."3,"I've sat through enough terrible faith-based movies to appreciate it when there's a decent one like Risen. Specifically, I like how they tell the resurrection story as if it were a detective mystery where Mary Magdalen & Jesus's other apostles are the suspects. In the end the film could've been stronger & more complex, but on its own terms, it kind of works."3,"Just as entertaining as it's predecessor, London Has Fallen is a fun movie with some well shot action scenes. Though the main plot of the movie is quite far fetched and filled with cheesy one-liners, you should already know that going what you're getting into and enjoy this one for what it is: a 90's action throwback."3,"It may not be quite as original or hilarious as it would like to think, but it's a perfectly enjoyable, naughty ride that revels in making fun of itself, Marvel and the whole Hollywood system. Reynolds was practically born for the role (it's basically Van Wilder in spandex), so even when the film has some shortcomings, he's always around to keep us laughing. Expect plenty of imitators to follow."3,"Hmm, I am not sure why lots of people liked this. I knew it wasn't a really big alien battle again. Pretty much the whole movie takes place inside this one bunker with this Psycho big guy who believe's everyone is dead and must keep them alive. This is a slow going movie and has very little exciting moments. I liked the girl Michelle who was the Final Destination 3 girl in this movie. Your mind is always bouncing around whether to believe the guy Harold or not. The last 20 minutes is where it starts to get good. It would have been a lot worse if the finale of this movie didn't exist. I was kind of bored watching but it wasn't that bad. It was just ok until the ending."3,"This is one of those biopics that tells a story that we all know and doesn't manage the necessary to raise it above its limitations; instead, it suffers from a one-dimensional protagonist that never becomes intriguing and ends so abruptly that it feels like Frears got tired of telling it."3,"This film's heart is in the right place, and the performances (specifically Michael Shannon's) are stellar. Unfortunately, this film falls short of what it could have been and is ultimately disappointing."3,"A nice showcase for, in my opinion, one of Hollywood's most under-rated actors. I'm talking about Michael Shannon. His chemistry with young actor Jaeden Lieberher makes this a movie worth seeing."3,"This weird avant garde like picture, is the type of film that will appease as well as wet the likes of David Lynch, but hardly anything allegorical compared to Alejandro Jodorowsky. The entire film plays out with many different plot and story threads loosely connected as if it's a bunch of stock footage smashed together, to try and make some connection. Whether it's expressed through words on screen or acting counterparts, the plot an narrative are incredibly hard to follow, but kind of make a thoughtful connection as if the audiences are in some LSD trip. If that's the type of film you like, you may enjoy it a lot more than I did, it just didn't seem to fit together in my case and would maybe give it another viewing a couple if not several years from now to try and make some intellectual sense."3,"A good premise for a schlock slasher horror and a low budget psychedelic finale are unconvincingly mashed up into a horror movie that doesn't know what it wants to be and succeeds at being confusing while failing at being scary in any way shape or form. Nonetheless it has some great costume design and interesting lighting so maybe, just maybe it's worth it."3,"I was going to go on about how this was done before with The Act of Killing but then I see this is a follow-up film by the same bloke. This also shows murderers describing their acts with ignorant pride but this seems to be more of a family issue as he was trying to find the people responsible for killing his brother. I have to say, some of the interviews were a little bit awkward and unnecessary. Unlike the previous film, here, he seems to milking it all a little bit. Still, a good job exposing the horrible things that have gone on and seem to be still a real problem in Indonesia. I still have no urge to go there."3,"I didn't think this movie was too bad. I liked how they picked right up where the first one ended. Quite a bit of blood and gore, but pretty much the same gags as the first one. All and all, I would recommend this one especially if you dug the first one."3,"I'm not convinced that this is the brilliant psychological portrait everyone seems to think it is, but Moss gives one hell of a performance."3,"Puts you in a homeless mans shoes. Made me think about how i would react, how i would feel. It's a good movie to watch on a rainy day or when you don't feel like going out."3,"I do like this movie. I thought the ending was a bit clichÃ©. It was predictable but overall, it was a cute movie. The problem I had with it mostly, was the character of Jessica Alba. I found her to be a bit hypocritical. She came off as cold and unfeeling. Her character was came off as a b*tch. Pierce Brosnan's character seemed a bit naÃ¯ve about a few things as well. His chemistry with Salma Hayek was certainly a plus. They seem natural together. I liked it but I didn't love it."3,"Hip-Hop and Rap music all the way to the end (obviously in Japanese). A little non-sense story, with japanese pop culture themes, but with nice photography. Reminds me a hip-hop version of ""The Warriors"" without a better story and with music all the way (only watch it if you like the music!)."3,"For what it is, ""The Square"" will attract many viewers solely based on it's true display of young adults fighting for their right to freedom in many areas of life. The imagery is brutally realistic and almost made me look away. I give props to these guys for making such a touchy film, but they pulled it off. It is a bit boring, and much of the same questions are asked and answered multiple times, but it is a very effective film that will be in my head for a while. The imagery has scarred my brain. I just cannot believe how some people in the world behave. Overall, it is a well put together film that deserves it's nominations. Displayed first through Netflix, this opened the film to many viewers around the world. I honestly cannot recommend this film, and I will never watch it again, but I admired it."3,"Pat Mills delivers a fantastic performance as a washed-up child star, but the film itself stumbles in quite a few areas. Overall, a solid dark comedy with some final act issues."3,"A very Woody Allen-inflicted romcom. It's a little predictable in terms of its concept and stories like this have been done before, but I liked that it was somewhat true to life and O'Brien and Waterston had great chemistry together. Manhattan Romance doesn't add anything new to its genre, but still it's an enjoyable flick with some great moments."3,"Sounds like most of the negative reviews is because the movie doesn't focus on the terrible living conditions and sad lifestyle in which they must live in, but in this case it's obvious the director wanted the kid's dangerous adventure to be the main attraction more so than it being about how bad it is where they live. It was a very solid movie that opened my eyes to many things, even if the director didn't make it his main focus of the movie."3,"Honestly, the plot for this neo-noir is nonsensical, and panders so much to Mainland Chinese notions of justice that it avoids taking the subject matter to its logical dark conclusion. But the many visceral action sequences and fine performances make it quite watchable."3,"A great slice of life film that chooses to see the humor in what could have been a much more depressing film. However, that jovial spirit took away from the characters, teetering towards tired stereotypes a little too often for my taste. I think I would have preferred some more honesty throughout the entire film, instead of just at the end. That said, I loved Alexandra, she was really the best character in the film. Also- It's impressive that this was shot on iPhones but I found the camera work to be inconsistent, especially towards the beginning."3,"In terms of its form, it's subversive. Deadly serious themes are explored to a point where they become a caricature - also thanks to a grotesque acting style."3,"This movie was entertaining. If you like slow atmospheric stuff. The end was a let-down. Maybe a failure in plot. Sometimes too self-indulgent (camera focus, cross fade) Soundtrack worked. Acting was decent. Script could have been more entertaining/less naturalistic. Yadda Yadda Yadda."3,"The Wolfpack is a band of literal brothers, trapped by their oddly protective, near cultish parents in a tiny lower-east-side apartment with a library of old movies as teachers. The documentarian lives inside this world, obviously after the period of isolation had ended, but still, we get the sense of the true weirdness of their lives, and the liberation, fear and amazement as they begin to enter the world outside that building. Where the hell did they come from, that was my unanswered question."3,"This movie is very slow and I spent a lot of time yelling at the idiot father because he needed to do something to save his child, but that ending is completely unexpected and brilliant."3,Taut drama about extreme parenting choices taken too far.3,Greece's Best Foreign Language Film submission for this year's Academy Award failed to make the recently announced shortlist so therefore it won't be nominated. Its a nice sweet little movie with a couple of appealing performances from its 2 young leads Kostas Nikouli and Nikos Garcia. Worth seeing if unspectacular3,"This is one of those biopics that tells a story that we all know and doesn't manage the necessary to raise it above its limitations; instead, it suffers from a one-dimensional protagonist that never becomes intriguing and ends so abruptly that it feels like Frears got tired of telling it."3,"Brooklyn features the most uncomplicated narrative in a serious film that I have seen in years. Girl from Ireland immigrates to America. Lives in Brooklyn and falls in love with an Italian boy. Goes back home to Ireland. Meets Irish boy. Likes him. (Kind of.) Must choose between the two. That's it. Someone really burned the midnight oil writing this one. Alright, I'm being a bit too harsh. Brooklyn is a pleasant, charming, and straightforward yarn that appeals mostly to older audiences and makes no excuses for its deliberate pace and simple structure. (And I do mean older. In my theater there probably wasn't a person other than myself under 50 and it smelled like licorice.) It's helmed entirely by Saoirse Ronan and her presence and affability make the film more than watchable. It bears much in common with An Education, which was another underwhelming, but ultimately likeable period piece nominated for Best Picture that showcased an up-and-coming actress. Said actress and the old-fashioned feel are the reasons to see Brooklyn, if that kind of thing appeals to you. Otherwise give it a pass."3,"I was honestly expecting more--much more. All the pieces of a great film were there--great cast, important story--but The Big Short fails to do any of these elements justice due to some questionable directorial and editing choices made by McKay and a striking lack of depth. I commend the film, however, for providing a digestible perspective on the 2008 crisis and another venue for Bale and Carrell to show off their acting skills."3,"There were way too many jokes that were most likely written by a five year old except for one joke that made me chuckle. Other then that, the movie itself is worth the price of admission."3,"Paris-based provocateur Gaspar Noe's compelling sexually explicit 3D art-house porn melodrama. It concerns a sensual young couple in Paris, the beautiful, but unstable Electra, well-played by Aomi Muyock, and her horn-dog lover Murphy, superbly played by Karl Glusman, their highly sexual relationship starts spinning out of control as they let their desires run wild, and invite a pretty hot neighbor into their bed for a threesome. Interesting film with a very thin plot, but worth a look for it's many truly titillating real sex scenes, which are some of the hottest ever filmed for a mainstream film, and beautifully photographed with superb lighting, the 3D effects are good but distracting. Be warned that this an extremely sexually graphic erotic film with scenes of an ejaculating cock, full frontal nudity, threesome sex, public sex, homosexual sex, trannies, and sex clubs. Recommended."3,"I'm not a fan of Amy Poehler but I love Tina Fey, and she totally steals the show in this enjoyable comedy that feels satisfying enough even if it is a bit overlong (like an extended sitcom episode) and the jokes are not as funny or frequent as they should be - hell, some of them fall real flat."3,"Having James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe as the lead actors made all the difference in this latest reboot of Frankenstein. But the best of their acting chops could not lift the film from its ludicrous script. Entertaining, but forgettable."3,"It's a mighty task to boil the Bard's classics down to a tight yet meaningful running time and maintain a degree of cinematic quality. You don't just want to film a stage play with the mighty parameters of film, and yet giving in to the visual majesty means less time for Shakespeare's stirring words and complex characterization. Woe unto thee who attempt an adaptation. It requires more skill than thou would believe. I had hopes for the latest version of Macbeth from its top-shelf cast, Michael Fassbender as the titular ambitious murderer-turned king and Marion Cotillard as his wife and co-conspirator. It didn't take long for my hopes to be dashed. First, the good: the rolling hills of Scotland are lushly photographed, and the concluding battle is set amid a roaring hellish fire and flying embers that makes for a stunning backdrop. The actors are fairly fine. If you couldn't tell from this faint praise, there's not much to credit as an achievement with this Macbeth. It's strangely narcotized and often listless. It doesn't help that the actors speak 80% of their dialogue in whispers or mumbles, even when they discover the former king has been murdered. Director Justin Kurzel (the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie, also with Fassbender) falls back on monotony, whether it's an overabundance of mist, similar and low-rent locations, and a plodding score that feels like scorpions are in your mind. Some of the changes are also for the worse, especially making Lady Macbeth more ""sympathetic"" and neutering one of Shakespeare's great characters. She no longer sleepwalks and instead confesses her unshakable guilt to a cross. Also Macbeth is haunted by the ghost of his dead son with the witches. And there's some brief inclusion of awkward sex amidst monologues. The final showdown comes at the 90-minute mark and the entire proceedings feel rushed and yet miraculously boring. Even the bloody violence is pretty tame considering its R-rating. If you're looking for a truly cinematic Macbeth that enlivens Shakespeare, check out the Masterpiece Theater version with Patrick Stewart adapted into a 1930s Stalinist era. Now that was brilliant. Kurzel's version of the ""Scottish play"" is one that only signifies disappointment."3,"If you're reading this review of this film there's a good chance you might've read a couple of the others out there. A consensus becomes apparent: here is the typical fish story about the big one that got away. There's several reasons put forward and now I'll add mine to the tumult. This one was lost in the editing room where I believe the music of the piece got away. The shots are there for all to see, Howard's made a classic, its still in there, but the work should be recut. As it is you've several powerful what might have been images to gape open-mouthed at ... until there's a Director's Cut released."3,"Tyler Labine is very likeable; a fresh, poignant take on the coming-of-age genre set against a backdrop of pleasing Canadian scenery."3,Was not a fan. Although there were moments that shined. Felt like the acting really slacked. Actors did not seem real connected to their characters. It lacked the heart the original had. The singing was good but the acting really suffered. It seemed like some were over acting and others were not acting enough. Has nothing on the original. They might have done better to remake Grease 2. If they did I would have loved it in comparison!3,"Tom Hardy is the main (or in fact only) reason for you to see this film, playing twin brothers and stealing the scene especially as the insane, dangerous and hilariously bizarre Ronnie Kray, but as a biopic it is flawed and conventional like many other gangster movies alike."3,"If you give the story time to develop, then it is rewarding. Jared Breeze is completely believable, in his role."3,"I really didn't care about the characters much, but it was a non-cheesy and realistic movie about what it would be like to die of cancer in your late 30s."3,this film was just ok. This film was on the weak side but i liked how the kid got so good at chess.3,"This adaptation of Stevenson's classic adventure novel was Disney's first 100% live-action film. As with a lot of similar Disney fare, it's rather too 'Technicolorful' for my taste, in general glossing over the blacker elements of the story, though the occasional tinge of darkness does prevail, for example Israel Hands' (creepily played by Geoffrey Keen) pursuit of Jim Hawkins (Bobby Driscoll) up the ship's rigging. The film badly fluffs Stevenson's masterly opening, but it doesn't do too bad a job of representing the flip-flopping morality of Long John Silver's relationship with Hawkins. Robert Newton's performance as Silver is appropriately and enjoyably hammy, but his supporting players are either unnecessarily over the top themselves (Walter Fitzgerald's Squire Trelawney and Geoffrey Wilkinson's Ben Gunn) or blandly unappealing (Driscoll, and Dennis O'Dea's Dr. Livesy). Not bad."3,"Peter O'Toole carries the whole film, since everyone else completely fails. Yet the film is also aimless and lacks variation and surprise. Watch only if you are a fan of O'Toole. Otherwise, nothing to see here."3,"Some aspects of this film were amazing and I really loved the ball room scene leading up to the end. BUT, and I know I'll sound like a philistine, it was 3hrs+, and to add more to my philistinosity (i know it's not a real word) I kinda feel you can tell a story in 2hrs or less, accept for some occasion, the Leopard not being one. I felt much like an early, and much more refined and well versed Peter Jackson, Visconti was a little too self indulgent with this one. I mean what film maker wouldn't want to have their films over 3hrs? I know I would, but I understand that not everyone wants to see me masturbate onto celluloid. This although is not to said this is a bad movie, it's quite brilliant, I think."3,sissy and tommy lee are both very very good but the film could have used a little editing.3,"Solid early modern biopic. There's very little genuine conflict in the movie, but Busey gives his character enough like to keep the movie interesting."3,"It is ironic that this was considered to be Laughton's star turn because it is probably one of the worst performances that I have seen him in. This Henry is the stereotyped one and not the one played with nuance. For that reason, this picture never grows to the extent that it could."3,"This movie was boring, but at least I learned that people were concerned about animal cruelty in the twenties. If you like bull-fighting and sappy romance, though, you will enjoy this."3,"Thanks to Groucho's spitfire wit, Chico's incessant scheming, and Harpo's innocent antics, ""A Day At The Races"" churns out constant smirks and chuckles from the other end of the silver screen."3,"Gently amusing satire of capitalist corporations, probably before the term had even been invented. I'm not the biggest fan of Ealing, but it's light comedy with a brain."3,"An interesting film. At the time this film was seen as very risky due to the fact it deals with homosexuality. The main plot involves lawyer Melville Farr (played by Dirk Bogarde). Although married Farr is secretly a homosexual. Farr becomes involved in a blackmail investigation after one of his fri...(read more)ends kills himself after being blackmailed due to them also being a homosexual. Farr then faces the decision of turning the blackmailers in (therefore ruining his career) or order them to keep quite, therefore becoming a blackmailer himself. At the time of release (1961) homosexuality was still illegal so obviously the film was considered quite ground-breaking. These days the film does seem a little dated, yet there is still a solid crime story in it."3,"Not the weird for the sake of being weird movie that I expected but has many unconventional & absurd moments, Overall fun & funny"3,"A film that quite possibly showcased Monroe playing herself, especially late in her career. Nell was unstable and not able to handle the pressures of the outside world (hence the metaphor of being a sort of live-in nanny, cut off from the rest of the world but protected as well). Monroe's's late-career personal troubles and demons were well documented and attested by her suicide. Even though this film was early on in her career it offers a chilling and eerie view of what's to come for the legendary actress. They say the best of the best actors and actresses draw upon their very souls to come up with their startling performances. I think Monroe was pulling from her very core in this film. Worth a viewing and analysis."3,Makes no damn sense at all. Pretty colors though. This was like a Daniel Clowes yakuza comic with more than a few pages missing.3,"This one lacked the freshness of its predecessor, but it is in all other ways competant. Everyone who made the original great are back, but I think this one suffers a little in its attempt to up the ante. Otherwise this one is really beautiful and entertaining."3,See this if only for the dance scene where Gene Kelly is a 'biker'. He is absolutely superb.3,"How does an audience feel watching two depressed characters fail to cheer each other up during a depressing time period in Italy? Well, I don't know about you, but I was both depressed and bored. I'm a big fan of both Loren and Mastroianni, but I love to see them do stuff, have fun, overcome obstacles... and none of that happened here. This is a slice of life story, and it seems more suited for the stage than for film. It isn't even interesting visually. In fact, the set, costumes, and general mis-en-scene, are also really boring. I'm not going to say that it's a terrible film, though. In the character's interactions and dialogue, there was a bit of tension and a promise of furthering the story. Unfortunate that nothing comes of it, but I liked thinking that something would happen. Plus, it's hard to make this setting fun. So, I'm going to say this movie is just so-so."3,"The acting is certainly here, both leads give a great performance, Marcello in particular is his usual powerhouse self and kind of carries the film. Other then that it's a bit to melodramatic, and, well, pointless? It doesn't really offer any social or intellectual themes and it doesn't come around to any satisfying conclusion about anything. Entertaining while it lasts though."3,"Mid English period Hitchcock isn't among the master's best but a good tight thriller with many of his later touches evident. He's fortunate here to have two strong leads in Oscar Homolka and especially Sylvia Sidney with her wonderfully expressive eyes. If you've only seen her in her later work say Beetlejuice or An Early Frost, her youth and beauty will come as a surprise."3,"WELL PRODUCED WITH SOME OUTSTANDING AFRICAN SCENERY. MELODRAMATIC THOUGH, GOOD CAST WITH A FINE GREGORY PECK PERFORMANCE. SO SO WRITING. NOT BAD."3,"In short, I preferred Rio Bravo. El Dorado is perhaps grittier, or at least more violent, but lacks the atmosphere that Hawks was able to cultivate with the original. James Caan is a better sidekick and a much more interesting character than Bravo's Colorado. Mitchum's performance just doesn't do it for me though. Of course Wayne is good but I didn't feel as drawn to Cole Thorton as I did John T. Chance."3,"It's kind of hard to care about Antoine when he is so stupid, i guess that's part of the point, kids are stupid, but it doesn't help that every single adult is portrayed as some kind of ogre, or simplistic doofus. I also guess that i'm not suppose to sympathize with Antoine, but then, what's the point?"3,"William Powell stars as Godfrey, a ""forgotten man"" dragged off to a scavenger hunt party by a pair of spoiled rich girls (I guess Paris Hilton is more of a cliche than I thought). While one sister is cold, the other is caring (if somewhat flakey) and decides to hire Godfrey as the family butler. After Godfrey surprises everyone by showing up to work looking like a professional butler, it's revealed there's more to him than meets the eye. And of course, the air-headed girl falls in love with him. The depiction of wealth is pretty typical for the 1930s time period, one reviewer described these people as the ""idle rich"", but it all gets a little bit one dimensional. The romance seems trumped up, even by screwball farce standards (actually, William Powell and Carole Lombard were divorced three years when they made this film, and it's hard to be romantic towards your ex, even if it is just acting), and the ending of the film, from the homeless solution to the romantic conclusion, seems tacked on. However, some of the set pieces and gags do work, and it's difficult to knock William Powell as just about everything he does has a certain charm."3,"There are a few interesting ideas sprinkled throughout The Vanishing; it is a soundly-crafted and even film. Thus, the problem with it isn't a weak link, but merely a lack of power. The movie doesn't have enough for you to get behind, with its threadbare plot and simple characters.Â The ending, which is what launched The Vanishing into such prestigious quarters twenty years ago, is still a neat way to bring the movie to a close - but it doesn't salvage the affair completely. The movie simply doesn't accomplish enough to weather the test of time. It is competent, but not outstanding."3,"Even if the plot drags in the first two acts, eliminating the tension and making the mystery feel bland and not engaging, this is an interesting effort that finds a curious balance between humor and horror, with a smart meta-twist in the third act that justifies all that came before."3,Uninspired documentary about the elusive John Fahey. It does not get under the surface but features some great anecdotes.3,"Although it doesn't carry the same weight as Doomsday, Unbound returns some fear to Brainiac, adding some brawn to the brains. Kal-El's life lessons never seem to cease throwing themselves at him on Earth, despite having established it as his home. Kara's character development is also admirable, what with her age and correlating fear established firmly. With moderate tweaking in story, this could have made the big screen."3,"Ingmar Bergmans early but still mature film focuses on young love, and heartbreak, that's still relevant today. Lars Ekborg was extremely impressive for a young actor. Many (not including myself) find it hard to feel acting of foreign cinema, if this performance doesn't convince you it can be great, than you're trying not to like it. There were bland sequences here, and it didn't have a full Bergman spunk. That being said its still a hefty romance that can be enjoyed sixty years later."3,"Engrossing but dispiriting look at a late-night radio hero to the counterculture of the late '60s and beyond. Without intending to, this love letter to Bob Fass becomes just as much about the capacity for noxious self-mythologizing and that the accumulation of years doesn't equate to wisdom or perspective."3,"Not as good as Under the Red Hood for my money, but a step up from Year One. The plot takes awhile to get going and the lack of a proper back story robs it of some much needed motivation towards the beginning because how things got to this point would be interesting to know without having to re-read the whole Batman mythology. It's not like we need a huge background check, just a little reminder like they did in Under the Red Hood. The plot is not one of the strong points, especially since this ends on a cliffhanger and has that incomplete feeling Part 1's tend to have. The mutants are not particularly the best of villains for Batman even though their leader is certainly his equal in terms of muscle power. It does have some decent animation and brutal action sequences that are bloody and intense. Not for little kids in other words. The news segments carried over from the graphic novel simply do not work and feel tacked on. The vocal performances are alright, but not as good as past entries. There's potential here for an even better Part 2 and I certainly hope that is the case. Part 1 is watchable and with a promise of bigger things to come, I am certainly looking forward to Part 2."3,"Dead Sushi contains everything that is vintage Noboru Iguchi, except the sushi isn't dead. It's alive.Yes, there is a story and it is as ridiculous as its title, but it does tie all the nonsense together. The 90 minutes do actually flow from beginning to end; it's just laced with everything a family film needs, which is extreme violence, gore, nudity, and grotesque situations.The CG is of low budget and the violence is incredibly over the top, but that is what makes Dead Sushi as amusing and humorous as it is.Rina Takeda is a joy. Her personality on screen, blended with her martial arts background, make her a solid lead for this picture. Not to take anything away from Asami, because she ends up with memorable scene after memorable scene. The Robot sums them up quite nicely.Dead Sushi definitely isn't for everyone, but for it's target audience it is an entertaining sit through."3,"Well made, but no surprises for anyone who read the original story, and probably not many surprises for those who haven't. A certain obviousness kept this from really soaring for me."3,"Enjoyable western, Paul Newman plays a white man raised by Injuns, and kicks some ass. Martin Balsam plays a very convincing Mexican, but the standout performance is Richard Boone, who plays a complete asshole cowboy to end all complete asshole cowboys."3,Sad and creepy but still very watchable thanks to the usual excellent direction of William Wyler and the accomplished playing of Samantha Eggar and especially Terence Stamp whose icy demeanor as well as his ice blue eyes have rarely matched his character so well. The ending is chilling.3,"As cutesy as the chemistry between Fonda and Stanwyck is, Preston Sturges' ""The Lady Eve"" almost buckles underneath the weight of its own lack of genuine belly-laugh-inducing comedy."3,"Another in a string of Bette Davis' comeback movies of the sixties, ""Dead Ringer"" feels and looks recycled, but has all the mystery and charm of a Davis' film. What feels recycled ultimately boils down to the fact that many of the pieces of the plot are the same as other, better films. Davis had played identical twins earlier in the 1946 film ""A Stolen Life"" and Olivia de Havilland had basically played the same kind of role in a very similar film entitled ""The Dark Mirror"" from that same year. Murderous twins have always been an interesting thriller concept and noir staple, because of the extremes that siblings can present when they are given the chance to kill. Davis was reemerging in the public sphere after her Oscar nominated turn in ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"". This film and another film of that decade put Davis back into the limelight and with good reason. She was the queen of the film noir as well as acted in dramatic turns in the thirties and forties. This film exploits her popularity to the fullest, as well as her newfound fame, and without her this film would not have had the same impact, and wouldn't have been enjoyable. Another great performance in this film comes from legendary actor Karl Malden. It's his curiosity into the death of his girlfriend and compassion towards her twin sister that really makes a statement about how a person changes when they murder someone, no matter how sweet or innocent they were beforehand. It seems obvious why Edie kills Margaret: because she is in debt, her sister has everything because she married her former beau, and Edie has had a hard, miserable life. Her impersonation of her sister isn't always spot on, and the ensuing story about her living day to day, trying to keep up the mirage she's concocted, doesn't do much except tell us about the social life of Margaret. The film doesn't say much about Edie as a character, or how she feels while deceiving everyone, including her boyfriend, which is especially damning. She is immediately demonized after killing her sister, and is oftentimes shown to be unreliable, calculating, and very bitter. This film only emphasizes Davis, and most of the film is exposition that includes her own musings. The peripheral characters are mostly slags and socialites, and except for Karl Malden, none of them give any insight into the character of Margaret, who remains a mystery except for what little insight Tony gives us, which is only that he exists. Only the ending tells us anything about either twin, gives us any moral, or any damning existential question."3,"For a movie called The Mummy, the movie is certainly about The Mummy... maybe too much so. I see this as just another excuse to get Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in the same movie together, somehow. The film is so repetitive and explains the same things over and over again, even going so far as to having a lengthy backstory scene, that it's at a constant state of halt. It doesn't move like a natural narrative should, with fresh information and character development at all times. Maybe I'm just asking too much though. After all, this is a Hammer Horror production, and is a bit of a remake of the Universal original, but I think just a little bit more attention could have been paid in the details to make it better. The make-up work is good, and it's shot well, but its slow pace, or lack thereof, make it a difficult movie to sit through. Not that it doesn't have its charms, but it's definitely not perfect."3,Wasn't so much into this movie but I did like it.3,"I think Buster Keaton is one of the more inconsistent actors from the silent film era. I really didn't like The general but I adored Sherlock Jr. This one I would say is ok. Buster and the woman who rejected to marry him accidentally both end up on a ship at sea alone. In this journey they encounter a storm, cannibals, and a scary painting of sailer. Now there were some nice laughs in here but at the same time for a film only an hour long I shouldn't have been bored as much as I did."3,"While I found it an interesting watch I don't see in it everything that others apparently do - sure it was good, but is it really worth raving about? When it came out maybe, but now? I did like Marilyn Monroe's small role though, and personally found no fault with any of the technical elements. I possibly would watch it again if it was on at a reasonable time, but wouldn't necessarily make an effort to re-watch it."3,"Francois Ozon's 'See The Sea' may only be 52 minutes long, but my does it hit you!Â The conclusion may be predictable, but it's no less shocking. From the moment the backpacker turns up it's obvious she's not quite right, though Sasha, through her loneliness is oblivious to it. Whilst Sasha may be lonely I find it hard to believe that any mother would not only leave their baby with a stranger, but also leave them alone on a beach whilst they go off looking for casual sex.Â Overall a very disturbing film but no doubt effective, fans of Ozon should defiantly try and see it."3,"This movie was okay, it was really long and predictable. The role that Lizabeth Scott played just really annoyed me. I'm not sure if it was her acting or just her, but I know the movie probably whould have been ten times better without her character."3,"The presumed death of a woman spurs a detective's investigation of her life and his slowly burning affection for the victim. A classic noir story shot in the brilliant shadows of forties noir cinematography with all the snappy dialogue that we come to expect of the genre, Laura is fun to watch. The actors' rapid fire delivery presents quick wits, and I always like how fast these films move. The story is as circuitous as The Third Man, but Laura is clearly not as strong because the relationship between McPherson and Laura is not as well developed as The Third Man and a greater mystique is built around Orson Welles's character; regardless, to be mentioned in the same breath as The Third Man is an achievement. Overall, if you like noir films, then this one delivers."3,Tale of two men in seething 16th-century Japan has a color and panorama which makes this absorbing film fare.3,"Rather disturbing movie. Perspective is seemingly biased. News accounts of actual crime told a different tale, so I am not sure that I am buying the ole ""he made me do it"" perspective. She is just as much of a nutcase as he is, I think."3,An ok action/drama film as a young reporter discovers a possible cover-up by a group of police officers. Which puts his own life in danger. There are better examples of this type of film around though.3,"I was very young when I saw this movie and it might be the reason why I seem to enjoy it even today more than others. There are funny parts and Bobcat is extremely enjoyable here. I have owned this on VHS for years now, however it has never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray...it's as if no one wants to acknowledge this movie ever existed."3,"This flick is hilarious and doesn't know it. Much as I love David Boreanaz in full goth garb, this movie makes NO DAMN SENSE. And I just don't like Edward Furlong."3,"Not a bad sequel to the original film, this time a crew of people go back to try and get the contents of the vault. Good cast and story line."3,"This sequel came out 7 years after the original, and had this been a commercial success then a third was planned with the survivors ending up on their way to a hearing, but get trapped in a train tunnel on the way, but it was never done, but later adapted for a Sylvester Stallone film, This movie is very different to the novel but The boat manages to stay afloat despite a huge hole in both ends, despite this a tugboat find the ship and set out to claim salvage rights, [what no Army or Navy? To check for further survivors? Also a group of bad guys who want to get the plutonium! Off the ship, whilst pretending to be Greek Orthodox medics. Although there was no mention of plutonium in the first film, and just why would a Passenger ship be carrying it, I have no idea! Also other people still alive try to fight their way to to surface. I always hated Veronica Hamel being stabbed, but there is a lot going on in the film, it has aged well, and is far from bad, The cast is great with some really big names. But it is a ridiculous story,but if you can put that all aside , it's enjoyable afternoon viewing."3,Wishmaster 2 is alot better then the first one. If u like low budget cornball scarey movies this one will do nicely.3,"Certainly has cheesy, poorly-funded production characteristics, but is actually quite a good little thriller. Little lower-budget Terminator-envy shoot 'em up action sequences'll never hurt anybody...and it's a lot more enjoyable than many by-the-numbers ""good"" movies. Recommended, courtesy of yours truly."3,It was good enough for me to want to see how it ended.3,"Playback is a B-Horror film that in a sense is nothing more than a new take on the Amityville Horror. Instead of a demon possessing a house, the demon in this film, keeps his spirit alive on videotape, and when someone sees the tape, they become the next possessed killer. The story was entertaining but wasn't really anything new or extraordinary and the same can be said about the cast. The cast, led by The Covenant's Toby Hemingway, wasn't one of the most talented casts I've ever seen, but they may have been the best looking. There are some really good looking people in this film, and believe it or not, it helps to keep your attention. The film is a little dull and predictable at times, but there is always something nice to look at. This movie isn't original and won't shock or surprise you, but it may just entertain you for a couple hours and it will most certainly have your eyes glued to the screen."3,"Was expecting a lot more humor. I disagree with a lot of peoples reviews on this one. The sex scenes or half the movie, was a lil much. Not all of it was tasteless though. When awkward, I felt that it was fairly authentic and real. You sympathize with Romain as soon as you hear his virgin woes. This is teenage life, especially if you're male. All in all I liked this film. I'm also very sexual and open minded when it comes to talking about awkward subjects. If you are not comfy with sex talk don't see this film. Especially if you're not comfortable with your own sexuality. Keep this one away from the elderly. Although there is a good lesson to be learned from the older grandpa in this film. I found it enlightening at times. You just have to endure the risky business so to speak...."4,"Josh Mond's debut film is a probing character study, and an intimate portrayal of a mother-son relationship. Shooting his film almost exclusively in close-up shots, the film really allows viewers to understand the actions of the characters. While dealing with themes such as death and negligence, the film has plenty of humor in it too, and is carried by at least two great performances (Christopher Abbott and Cynthia Nixon). My only major fault with the movie is its conclusion, which feels a bit underdeveloped, asides with dealing with the base elements of what was necessary. Josh Mond will certainly be a talent to look out for."4,"Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay offer two astonishing performances in what is one of the best and most intelligent representations of Plato's cave that I remember seeing (and I love the scope of its philosophical ambitions), told from the point of view of a child who has never seen the world beyond a room."4,"The best sequel and best boxing film since Rocky. Stallone is superb and now I know why he was applauded and Michael B. Jordan is amazing as man trying to respect his legacy but find his own path to victory. Also good is Thomson as Jordan's singer love interest. Great directing, writing and cinematography. Was cheering in my seat and left the theatre feeling satisfied."4,"The critics are nuts! This was a movie filled with great special effects, good actors, lots of thrilling action scenes, and just great entertainment."4,"This movie infused comedy with drama and didn't overdue on either. I do not usually go for the dramatic, but am a big Tina Fey fan and she definitely delivered.Â It got me to care about what happened to the characters, and even made my eyes tear up a bit.Â The music fit the movie well and kept my restless feet tapping. The scenery was authentic and breathless at times, even amid the chaos of a war torn country."4,"Darn near perfect for the first hour. Unfortunately, it falls off a bit later on as the plot gets thinner (though like any decent movie, it has a good ending). It definitely earns its PG rating and has a lot of clever subtleties in dialogue. It's more oriented toward adults than might be assumed by its bonanza status. Smart ten year olds should adore it. The race thing is not as dominant as the critics make it seem, at least for the entire runtime. It's prominent, then disappears, then after the big twist becomes very prominent again, bordering on preachy. Anyway, it's good. The lead is really relatable. The world is really interesting. Go see it."4,"This was hilarious. No, no one expected it to be ""smart"" humor. It's a SBC movie, for Pete's sake! Remember Borat and the Dictator? This one is a great send-up of the recent spy action movies full of impossible action. And that is its target. Live with it, and laugh it off! Mark Strong is his usual serious self and that comes across quite funny in this movie, surprisingly!"4,I knew what i was in for... an action terrorist movie. IDK why people are saying its the same plot...DUH its the next in a series. I went in knowing what to expect and I think it was a good movie. Action oriented and nice to see a lot of the same people returned. Before you give a bad make sure you are going into a movie knowing or even thinking people!4,"While I found Deadpool in the comics to be rather annoying and unlikable, his film adaptation does everything right and turns him into a human being. It says a lot that some of the best scenes, besides the great jokes, are about his cancer and relationship. Overall you can tell that this is a film by fans for fans and no soulless mass product. The action is really well directed. It is over the top and brutal but not as gory as feared. The connections to the X-Men-verse work wonderfully, too and make for some of the best gags. Certainly no masterpiece like some films of Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a massively entertaining and fun experience. Deadpool will return and that's good news."4,"The ending is slightly disappointing, but that's only because everything that proceeds it is such a simple, tense, and unnerving thriller packaged with interesting themes (namely that men who infantilize women, even if it's not in a sexual way, are still dangerous misogynists) and excellent performances."4,"A really intriguing story Ben Foster gives a stellar performance, a nice watch led by some good actors/actresses."4,"One of the sexiest movies I ever seen. Finally a movie that takes every chance in the book portraying sex in film without the fear of a NC17/X rating or victimizing sex with addiction, consequences in a exaggerated way, or shaming. The actors are all great here giving it their all in both the talking and sex scenes with fearless and honest performances. The cinematography is absolutely stunning with great lighting choices and unique camera moves. The editing bothered me a little with the countless blank transition cuts but it wasn't the worst thing ever. Gasper Noe really has a interesting mind and I'm interested to seeing some of his other highly regarded movies. The score is electric and fun, the weakest part of the movie is probably the script and it felt like a 5 hour long movie but I enjoyed every minute of it. Take this movie as it wants you to take it as don't expect high art"4,"The casual nature of this film mixes romantic and comedy genres well. The chemistry between Lake Bell and Simon Pegg is spot on and they make an impressive pair. The premise is fun and indicative of the audience this film is trying to attract. The fact that the film makes these people complicated, obtuse, and difficult only adds to their realism as people with baggage and experience. Lake Bell does some great accent work, remains a relatable mess in the best of ways and plays off Pegg well. Both feel like lovable jerks and entertain throughout. Highly recommend for fans of both."4,"The victims provide the narrative arc in this film, a contrast with the Act of Killing's focus on perpetrators. Notable in this film is the artistic videography. the images are powerful and masterful. the symbolism of butterflies in cocoon for the unreleased memory of the perished is gently handled. And the way the old man's experience paralleled the narrative Adi's interviews was telling was the work of a master storyteller. a sometimes silent meditation of violators refusing to see the moral dimensions of their murdering - and an optometrist seeking their confession."4,"This film is particularly surprising. It's very interested in many of the facts of the real life obedience experiment. In fact, one could even argue that it seems to be very dry and non- climactic. The docudrama, of course, is restrained and doesn't overdo anything with large dramatizations of events and beats. I can also very much see many people getting bored with it however. Saarsgard is really great, totally inhabiting and creating that version of Milgram. Glad to see Winona Ryder on the screen again. Overall, it is very subdued, but it is a great introduction to the experiment that really shows as much as we can learn about what motivates people to commit such crimes."4,Richard Gere gives a brilliant performance along with Oren Moverman's masterful incorporation of disjointed chatter and haunting sounds that brings the jarring reality of homelessness alive in the richest country in the world.4,"The highlight with this film for me were the two lead actors. Both Luke Gss and Dolph Lundgren were superb. Unfortunately they were et down by some of the supporting cast who were almost unbearable. It was great to see a WW2 film released again and the props were awesome but the story line was very clichÃ©d and predictable. I thought this was Dolph Lundgren at his best so I do hope this foreshadows a comeback and as for Luke Goss, I think he is one of the most exciting newcomers to films in recent years. Really looking forward to seeing what he does next."4,"I have read the book that is based on, and i am glad it carries as many details as the book. The movie has a good voice acting (little bit akward at times) but gives life to its characters, way better than the human animation does, which for 2015, i think is outdated. Damn good movie, full with details and its nice to watch. Its shows people care for this movie."4,"What my friend described as 'Trippy'. The movie is hilarious and feels wrong at so many levels. An excellent movie for such a low budget. I don't know if the director-actor Pat Mills is gay or not, but if he isn't, then he wonderfully depicted one."4,"I'm not that used to writing reviews, but ""Manhattan Romance"" was too good not to. The film takes the classic love story between best friends and shakes it up a bit. The girl best friend is not about dating the guy best friend because of one little hitch, she's a lesbian. I love the plot twist that this film offers; it kept me guessing the entire time. I enjoyed the movie so much; I already planned a night watching ""Manhattan Romance"" with my friends."4,"A refreshing proof that you can make a funny and insightful film with a simple plot, naturalistic performances and an iPhone 5s - which adds to it and makes it look even more authentic, like a realistic fairy tale in the streets of L.A. (the character's name is even Sin-Dee Rella)."4,"An engaging look into the life of a young man whose considerable impact on helping to raise consciousness about the brutality of hate crimes has led to significant changes in the law and public perceptions. The film puts a human face on the life of someone who deserves to be remembered for more than just being a martyr for change. The film also elevates the circumstances surrounding his passing to bigger picture status, with some surprising insights about all concerned with this human drama."4,An exciting analysis of the beginning of a major change in political journalism to become a theater stage for egos as seen in this pivotal debate between two arrogant men who we can't deny were brilliant orators - even though I despise Buckley's political views and Vidal's aggressive ad hominem attacks.4,"It's a little bit of generic and old fashion, but I love it. This type of film reminds me of ""Before"" series. It's cute and easy to watch. Generic lines are used, but delivered in great and charming way. I don't know, but I am hooked with this kind of movies. If you're into conversational movies, with mature-corny-fun-dialogues, I think you'll like this movie. If you're experiencing or experienced something about love, or maybe a problem or struggles in a relationship, you can easily jive with this movie. But if you're someone who just likes to watch a good movie, I think you'll enjoy this one too. Don't mind the ratings; watch it if you like because for me it's worth my time."4,A nice documentary and great directorial debut from Ethan Hawke who I hopes continues as a director with showing great promise with this movie. It does feel more like a piano lesson after a while but the constant underscore of Seymour's piano skills and his insightful teachings make it feel less of a school lesson to an interment experience. I would have liked to see more archive on Seymour's rise but what you get is perfectly fine on its own merits4,"It's a fun documentary exploring an idea more than a subject. The interviews are strong with Margret Cho, Tim Gunn, Dan Savage, and George Takei but the moments of David Thorpe embarking his own experiment to change his voice kind of slow the movie down. Other than that, it is filled with interesting history, interviews, and ideas."4,"Anarchist cinematographic poetry. Luminous and inspiring, this wondrous story becomes pure magic with each new scene."4,LOVED this documentary.... very interesting and compelling. Thought the brothers have oodles of talent (seriously their batman costume made of cereal boxes is better than half the costumes I see in stores to buy). Would be neat to see how they are living like 5 years later and how this documentary has changed their lives... worth watching fo'sho4,An anguishing and extremely unsettling story that becomes more and more like a horror movie (with some nice use of ultra wide-angle lenses) as we witness a desperate man trying to prevent a newborn child from getting hurt by a foolish woman who is completely out of her mind.4,Fantastic acting and photography -- and a subject that is worth exploring.4,"Xenia is a predictable drama of brothers searching for their father. Yet, the characters are charismatic and their plight is absorbing enough to warrant its long running time. Likewise, it is an enlightening journey to contemporary Greece distressed with economic and social issues."4,Great Movie but there was a few problems with the movie like how it felt very rushed at times. Great soundtrack and moments that you will not see coming makes this a film worth seeing.4,"A really intriguing story Ben Foster gives a stellar performance, a nice watch led by some good actors/actresses."4,"What makes this handsome, sensitive drama so likable is not only Saoirse Ronan's remarkable central performance (and her undeniable chemistry with Emory Cohen), but also how well it understands the pain of homesickness and our longing to figure out where home is."4,"Adam McKay does a great job taking a convoluted subject and turning it into a very comprehensible film. All actors do a great job, especially Bale, Carell and Gosling, and the directing is unique with it's cutaways. This film is both funny and fascinating, and while I realize a lot of it is compressed, dramatized, the fact that this is all true (by Hollywood standards, but still this happened to some degree) is stunning."4,"The fact that this absorbing romance exists (and deserves) to be told is a tragic indication of this outrageous intolerance that has not been left in the past but sadly persists even today, and it is a beautifully-directed film that has two wonderful central performances and a gorgeous score."4,"At the great divide, comprised of the pro- and anti-Steve forces, Gibney tilts decidedly towards the anti, emphasizing his megelomaniacal personality and anti-social behavior in both personal and professional terms. The strength of the piece is the use of a vast storehouse of film and tape of the subject himself, a public figure for decades, as well as interviews with many of those closest to him, especially the naysayers. I found this a much more satisfying cinematic experience than Aaron Sorkin's fabulation, much less the dreary biopic featuring a talent-starved Ashton Kutcher."4,"A darkish yet less dark take on the familiar tale, which HP played surprisingly well as the nameless ""Igor"". But for me it was the mad McAvoy who stole the show with his crazed obsession & expressions."4,"I like exterme sports, so those scenes are AMAZING, more so then the original."4,"I would consider this the most underrated film of 2015. The story, script and production are all great and the whale looked amazing. The downside was the acting. The movie takes place in America, but the filmmakers felt the need to cast British, Australian, and Irish actors such as Tom Holland, Cillian Murphy, and the star, Chris Hemsworth. Holland was pretty good, which makes me anticipate him being Spider-man. But Hemsworth? His accent was so bad that it took me 30 minutes to realize it was American. Overall, other than the acting, pretty solid film.I would consider this the most underrated film of 2015. The story, script and production are all great and the whale looked amazing.

If you are a newcomer to the franchise, this sequel provides a captivating standalone story that is in no way diminished by not seeing the first film. It has a wonderful sound track, and amazing performances from both the original cast and newcomers. Hannah Marks is the standout performance in this film. Her portrayal of the young punk Penny was one of the highlights of my viewing experience. This coming-of-age story, set 18 years after the original - which puts it around 2003, is a wonderful Time. I'm sure You will enjoy joining these characters for the young punk odyssey."4,A perfect space film for kids off the back of gravity and the martian4,"I really enjoyed watching Ratter. You really get the full experience of how the hacker stalks and invades Emma's (Ashley Benson) personal space because throughout the movies there are many different view points. For example, you'll have a view point from her phone, computer, TV, pretty much any electronic device that can be hacked is a view point. It's addictively creepy! I wish they made a second movie."4,"What could be better than seeing Tom Hardy rank up against no one other than himself. 'Legend' just happens to be the answer to that, from screenwriter turned director Brian Helgeland it's a quip, fast paced, highly stylized and exciting British gangster flick based on the true life story of Reggie and Ronnie Kray, from 1960's London. Added to that with such a talented cast of admirable actors, including Australia's own Emily Browning as Reggie's love interest and provides a perfect intersecting narration viewpoint that doesn't even tend to comply to either side of the brothers devious deeds. 'Legend' is much like a Guy Richie or Matthew Vaughn flick, It's definitely worth a look, with such a well written and highly stylized narrative with great sets, costumes and performances even if from just Tom hardy alone as the two twin gangsters, that matches up to the film's title perfectly."4,"It was good, not great. Tom Hooper's direction wasn't as obnoxious and on the nose as les mis and kings speech, but he just can't control himself. The movie besides him is lovely and a great love story of a different sort. Alicia Vikander is a star and is so wonderful in the movie. She's had an amazing year and i can't wait to keep watching her in movies. Eddie Redmayne gives another great performance and his very subtle mannerisms and never plays Lili to broad. The last 15 minutes of the movie fall into typical maudlin movie fare, however its still lovely and worth a watch for these 2 give amazing performances."4,"If you are staying at a motel and see the owner's 9 year old son running around late at night in a pair of tighty whiteys with a can of gasoline, pack up the bags and get outta there. Jared Breeze, playing a budding serial killer, carries the movie on his back. And he is up against an all start cast and in a ""best of 2015"" movie. Plus one of the producers is a guaranteed hard hitter."4,"Filmed in Columbia, near Medellin (once the drug and murder capital of Sud America), this is truly an international film. It is a bit on the long side--almost two hours--and I swear nothing happens in the first 30 minutes, but then it is the pedal to the metal, as young Ted kicks a chicken to death and escalates from there. A great motion picture."4,"What a beautiful film about friendship and connection! and the acting was so great! I loved this film a lot! even thought it's hard to watch, specially when you know someone with cancer"4,Panahi dodges his 20-year ban in secrecy with this revealing and highly provocative piece of cinema veritÃ© that says a lot about Iranian society in general and even finds the most perfect moment to comment on the absurd censorship rules imposed on artistic freedom in Iran.4,"Kind of uneven, but with heart. Knowing it is based on a true story grips you and serves as a moral mist to your soul."4,A must see for any thrill-seekers looking for crazy footage compiled into a well delivered documentary about one of the greats.4,Nine film with good interaction between Kingsley and Pomeranc. Here we see the tension of the child prodigy..an expectation to fulfill genius while a childhood is still to be experienced. Nice.4,"Now this is a real classic, true acting being performed here, Newton is made for this role as he showed in numerous other pirate flicks and a sequel to this. Its extremely good and looks realistic for its time with glorious technicolour and some lovely matt painting work (if alittle fantasised). The whole film has that golden era of cinema look, crisp colours, dashing gents with well spoken accents and a great rugged historical shine that most modern modern flicks miss. I was brought up on classics like this, kids nowadays will laugh probably, shame, they know not of the real movies hehe"4,"It took a long time to bring this to television, but it was worth the wait. This movie is filled with great actors and it follows different stories of people infected with AIDS in the early years of the disease. It centers on the CDC's search for a cure, and the origins of the virus. This movie deals with alot from politics and how Ronald Reagan really dropped the ball for the Country. I could go on and on. Check this movie out, you will definitely learn a few things."4,O'Toole's warm yet hilarious Oscar-nominated performance elevates this modest-but-fun comedy massively.4,"Visconti's leisurely paced three-hour epic is a deeply sad and nostalgic meditation on mortality and the passing of an era. A sumptuous drama rich in nuances, with beautiful performances (especially Burt Lancaster) and an unforgettable extended ballroom scene in the end."4,"It's basically Dr. Strangelove if it was a drama. And a very fine drama it is. A Col. discovers a plot to overthrow the government by a 4 star general. The bulk of the film is the gathering of evidence against the general and they have less than a week to pull it off. Meanwhile the USSR do what they do best.Â While this film is basically a bunch of people talking for 2 hours, the tension is real and kept firm throughout. The resolution is quite clever and somewhat surprising.Â Stellar performances by all, but the real star is the writing. Check it out."4,A pretty good biopic and much better than the usual movie-of-the-week fodder. There is early Tommy Lee Jones here. Interesting how Hollywood forgets him for a few years.4,"Gary Busey not only did his own singing, but even lost 32 lbs to play Buddy Holly in this sensational musical biography of the singer from Lubbock Texas. Despite reportedly playing fast and loose with facts, the film is extremely entertaining. Busey was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his effective portrayal."4,"Beautiful story about the king, played by an oustanding performer Charles Laughton, who had 6 wives. Fine storytelling and wise humor makes this film a fun to watch."4,"I believe this is the longest of the Marx Brother's movies. It really didn't need to be so long, there were a couple of boring scenes. Other than that, the Brothers do all their usual jokes and run around being silly as usual, which is always fun, so I liked this movie anyway."4,"A young scientist has discovered an indestructible cloth that never gets dirty, a discovery that threatens the whole textile industry. Follows a pattern of witty and intelligent Ealing Studios comedies with dark undertones and a great performance by Alec Guinness in the leading role."4,"A man risking his career to expose a blackmailer is the focus of this story. Interesting enough, and more so because the risk is a barrister being exposed as a homosexual when such exposure is grounds for arrest and prison. Intelligently done, with the gay men (there are several being blackmailed) not portrayed as fey mincing freaks as they are in so many films, but as regular men. The film shows both sides of the homosexual issue -- the men who beg to be understood that they can't help what they are, and the prejudices of others who don't and won't understand. I was surprised to see Dirk Bogarde -- or any well-known actor -- in a part like this. Even now there are sometimes issues with actors playing gays in films, especially if they are secretly gay themselves. I can imagine the problems in 1962. I don't know Bogarde's orientation, nore does it matter. I'm just impressed that he would take such a risky role. I guess life imitates art in this case."4,"this probably is monroe's best performance, playing an unstable character very close to the edge and she is genuinely scary. richard widmark gives great support as a frustrated guy just trying to make time whose cynicism grows into compassion. and anne bancroft looks smashing in her film debut. suspenseful and underrated."4,"A 1966 colourful, quirky and funny action yakuza film, TOKYO DRIFTER is about a yakuza clan gone straight and the lead henchman Tetsue's efforts to keep them so when a rival gang try to turn them to the dark side again. It's got a black and white start, realistic streetscenes cutting to luridly mono-coloured stage sets, a muddling set of secondary characters, a 60's daytime discoteque and a catchy theme tune (called Tokyo Drifter of course) that keeps popping up whenenever our hero is looking suitably enigmatic or pensive. Directed by Seijun Suziuki, a Japanese director who made a number of B movies in Japan before his masterpiece BRANDED TO KILL got him banded from the studio for being too surreal. Not much known outside Japan either until equally maverick directors like Tarantino, Jarmusch and Takesh Kitano got him noticed in the 90's. If its good enough for them...Â "4,"Whale returns to his Frankenstein with this amusing sequel that has an even campier, deliciously wrier humor and also offers a lot more depth to Karloff's Monster - and it all seems more complete here (despite its gaps in logic), including a score that was absent from the original movie."4,"an excellent crime story. gabin plays a solid lead and scala is sexy in her limited role in a film that caught me by suprise. only loosely a heist film, it is fairly similar to much of melvilles great work. im glad i bought the film because i know i will rewatch it many times."4,it's still a powerful film about mob mentality and perhaps more about anarchism than lynching since it ignores the obvious racial issue. otherwise it seems a pretty glaring omission since at least 80% of lynching victims were black. i have to believe the studio wouldn't allow it to be referenced for commercial reasons. the film can also be read as anti-democracy given that the original title was mob rule. thx v :) mgm invades warner territory of socially conscious films. great performance by spencer tracy as everyman.4,"I really quite liked it. It's funny and smart, I highly recomend it."4,"Visual and sound gags galore in the more stuffier and French inspiration for Mr. Bean. Tati's M. Hulot bumbles upon a modern futuristic complex, which seems cooly dated, while tourists get in the way. I'm not going to front, Playtime is somewhat difficult to get through but the sound and visual design makes it entertaining and the set design and decoration is great."4,"It has been quite awhile since I watched an old movie and I've forgotten how delightful they can be. I've seen plenty of old screwballs and this isn't the best of the best, but it is funny and witty. And Williams is quite hilarious! Almost Grant-esque. Predictable story, but it made me laugh!"4,"another gangster classic that delivers. cagney was great as eddie bartlett and bogart plays a very convincing villian. although the film skips through the process of barletts rise to prominence, the story still flows well and satisfies as a rise and fall gangster story. great film."4,"The cinematography is the highlight here, as is the smart back-and-forth between diegetic and non-diegetic sound. I wasn't picking up a lot of the apparent subtle details, but it's definitely very smart in what it chooses to tell us and what it merely implies. I have a feeling this one will sink in deeper on second viewing"4,"Residents of an institution escape and wreck the grounds with childlike acts of vandalism and petty cruelty. The entire cast is composed of dwarfs. Almost plotless, but with moments that stick to your soul like a coating of grime (tiny Hombre laughing at the struggling camel may haunt your nightmares for years to come). Animal lovers beware."4,"A heartbreaking silent comedy re-released with a narration by Chaplin himself that only adds to it instead of standing in the way, and it is a classic that features numerous memorable scenes in one single film, some of them quite moving while others extremely funny."4,"An entomologist looking for bugs (he's looking for a specific one that will make a name for him in his peer group) in the sand of a seaside town misses the last bus of the night back to town and is convinced to spend the night in the home of a young woman, who lives in a small house in a mostly inaccessible sandpit, as do most of the other townsfolk. He slowly realizes that he has been tricked and that he is to stay there permanently. Thus begins a tale that is a metaphor for humans trapped in their existence and why they choose to not change their circumstances, even when given the opportunity...or at least partially about that. There's lots going on here. Beautiful photography of the sand dunes, and a couple of rather erotic love scenes between the two main characters. There is one potential sex scene that is pretty hard to watch, a bit reminiscent (to me anyway) of the ""party scene"" at the end of REQUEIM FOR A DREAM. The ending is left hanging a bit, and I haven't decided if the man's decision about his situation is a postive thing or a negative one."4,"After reading the glorious memoir Swanson on Swanson by Gloria Swanson I was ravenous to see more of her silent pictures from the dawning of the movie industry. This gem from overspending, OCD ridden director Eric von Stroheim was never officially finished as the production went over budget and there were significant disputes between Stroheim and Swanson, but what was salvaged is a beautiful piece of filmmaking. A type of grown up fairy tale with themes of romanticized violence, renegade from the Catholic Church, and the gamine charm of Swanson herself. Though the ending set in Africa was never filmed, which is a missing plot point, it's still a good watch for anyone with little resources for their own filmmaking endeavors and need inspiration. This was done with little budget and a million tiny problems, but is now a classic."4,Movie kept getting better as character played by Gregory Peck is developed. Ava Gardner and Peck are amazing together. John Hamm reminds me of Peck.4,"Excellent film is more an examination of friendship and loyalty than a conventional western. Serious considerations are leavened with a natural camaraderie between the characters and a fine sense of humor. Wayne and Mitchum work very well together, their interchanges have the lived in feel of old acquaintance with a young James Caan loose, sexy and funny as the gunslinger who can't shoot. The wonderful supporting cast and Hawks surehanded direction all contribute to making this a very fine film indeed."4,"Sharp-witted and a lot of fun even if you don't like ""old"" movies."4,Captivating and depressing saga about a man who loses his girlfriend to a sociopathic serial killer. This is a very good film that will stick with you in a very bad way.4,"An excellent Indie Horror with excellent acting, true-life humour, and a suspenseful, riveting sequence of events that will keep you on edge. Too bad it had a cop-out ending, leaving the audience needlessly dangling."4,An engrossing tour of this little-known subculture and unlikely habitat in the center of densely populated Manhattan.4,"The only thing I found detrimental to the movie was the ugly cyberpunk atmosphere, but the movie and its message are resound loudly for those willing to listen and look closely into its symbolisms."4,"Excellent documentary about Tim Hetherington, war and photography."4,"A interesting Mexican film about human relationships. Care for your fellow human, family issues and how love can develop between two woman, not as lovers, but as a daughter to a woman who she admires and helps personally and with her family. A very touching film."4,"A fresh, funny and deeply moving drama. LIPG leaves the melodrama aside and tells a great family story."4,"As an avid record collector, I can completely understand why the preservation of the video format is just as important as any other in this digital age, yet this documentary still surprised me in a lot of way. While it could have gone with a bit more funding for graphics and editing, this is still a very interesting, important and funny documentary. A must for film buffs."4,"Dealing with many themes closely related to his previous film ""Summer Interlude"" and taking place during Summer as well, ""Summer with Monika"" has a drastically different feel and ending to it. Sharply written, wonderfully acted and featuring beautiful shots throughout the entirety of the film all add up to a cohesive and poignant work of art! We follow a girl named Monika and her summer spent with a man named Harry escaping the adult world filled with responsibilities and hardships for a relaxing escape into their own world with one another. As the summer comes to an end however, things start to come back into perspective and the happiness abruptly ends and Monika who has grown bored eventually finds someone else. Harry takes their child out of the filth and uncaring ways of Monika in order to have a better life for the child's sake as Monika lives on in her empathy and lack of willingness to try or for that matter even care. This is a simple film that remains incredibly powerful to this day and is yet again another stunning film in Bergman's impeccable canon!"4,"A solidly entertaining adventure that's tremendously respectful to its material. It's a sharp, thrilling and action-packed first part to this two part comic adaptation."4,it is a must see! the documentary stays with you for a long time. waw it is unbelievable to see what people go through for something we take for granted. freedom!4,Always love a good documentary. This film shows the vital importance of bees and shows how greed and mans desire to control things we shouldn't might lead to our demise.4,"fun over the top silliness a lot of fun is had with the preposterous premise top notch camp cast in particular the cheating inn keepers wife steals every scene shes in, from performing the robot and showing how japanese kiss (its fucken gross)right through to spewing an endless amount of rice (almost as gross)"4,"It's a fan film, but a good one. The humor is sincere and the guys do a good job of being who they are, right down to Neil's stand-offish persona and label of ""The New Guy"". I could have used less Jack Black and not quite sure why he's supposed to be relevant to all things rock-n-roll??? Who should see this? Men between the ages of 15-55 who like real Rock."4,A damn fine animation. To call this a cartoon would be to undercut the pain and emotion it makes you fell. Hands down the best animated Batman film and third best Batman movie (maybe 2nd?).4,Each vignette adds to the mosaic. Characters from one turn up in another. Gradually a powerful outcome is arrived at.4,An unbelievable and revolting real story about an absurdly horrendous injustice suffered by a young man who has been trying to win a fight for over fifteen years now against powerful people who wanted to see him executed despite every indisputable evidence of his innocence.4,"I basically sobbed through a good portion of this, but I don't know how you couldn't. Its not a film that asks any real questions of the audience and I don't think it will change any minds about the ""right to die"" issue. However it presents unflinching scenarios of painful, ugly death and the prospect of choice and control in death. Its moving without ever being overly sentimental or political."4,"""We Were Here"" is a simple, yet powerfully effective documentary history of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco that creates a clear timeline of events, running from first rumors through effective treatment. This is told by a handful of survivors and eyewitnesses in their own words, recalling lost friends and loved ones, thus bringing such momentous events down to a deeply personal level. And the archival footage and photographs work well in tandem with this. Of particular interest is the valuable work of the lesbian community during the epidemic, previously a lesser partner in the larger gay community, rising to the occasion in more ways than one.(Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this was only glanced over in ""And the Band Played On"" by Randy Shilts.)"5,Best comedy to come out of Sundance since Napoleon Dynamite. We with a group of six friends and we all are going back on Sunday. Genius and insanely quotable. Whip smart script!!5,Could not imagine that a movie can create so many human feelings! Just amazing! It's really a masterpiece.5,"Loving the unpredictable effects, and is action-packed. The story line is great and it teaches us a lesson about judging a person's worth.Â "5,"It was a really funny, really fast-paced and super entertaining Disney animated family comedy adventure. It had really superb animation, really great voice cast, really great characters, really fast-paced action, really exciting adventure, really beautiful visuals, really great music, really funny humor and a really good story. This is the best and funniest Disney animated film since ""Aladdin."" This is one of the movies that I'm planning to see it again and again in the future. I really recommend this movie to both kids and adults."5,Fabulous movie. Made me cry. This is what America needs more of: Movies that make you want to be a better person.5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. While fictional, it is realistic and consistent with Biblical accounts of Jesus and his Apostles. Atheists should stay home, of course. As a believer, I loved the movie. Great acting, excellent story."5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had read the book and felt that while nothing can accurately capture the lyric beauty of Anne Rice's writing, this movie held true to the book. There is so much value I think for adults and children alike to see Jesus from his perspective as a child and experience his amazement at who he learns he is."5,"I really enjoyed this movie!! It's surprisingly different from what I was expecting from the trailer. Keeps you interested without doing too much as you usually get from this type of rom-coms. (Will watch again! Cassie's mystique was also an added bonus in my opinion, hope we get to see more of her acting but in other genres.)"5,"This movie is super fun and entertaining, I loved every minute."5,One of the ten most memorable cinematic experiences I've ever had!5,"This Futuristic film grabs you from the beginning. You get pulled into Frank Grieves world, where drugs are legal and most people are high 90% of the time. He struggles between the man that is a (Dreck) and being a good father. When a new super drug shows up to tests his belief in what is real. I loved the action packed fast-paced film. That leaves you on the edge of your seat."5,"Great touching movie, really shows simon peggs versatility and range. A heart touching and joyful exclamation this movie will make you both laugh and cry and realize that for every awful romantic comedy there is occasionally a truly good one."5,"An engaging story that is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. Great performances all around by Jeon Do Hyun, Kim Go Eun and Lee Byung Hun, but in particular by Jeon and Kim. Mesmerizing at times and heart-wrenching in parts, this movie stays in your mind long after you have left the theater."5,"This is a stunning film, with every department - writing, acting, cinematography, score, editing - at the highest level. Brilliant cinema."5,I feel sorry for the people who didn't see the fantastic humour in this film. I certainly would not have them on my party invite list. I shall definitely be watching this film again.5,It was an amazing movie on many levels. It is based on true life incidents and exposes the repression and the suffering that people have gone through in Iran. And the dancing was amazing. Thank God it ended well. Deeply moving and a courageous exposition of repression any where. Need to be seen by everyone just to know how much luckier we are to be living in the USA!5,"Much better than critics are making this look like. I went to see this film last month( in Mexico) and i enjoyed it very much. Pierce doesnt try to be charming and sexy, he is just that way by nature. I love Pierce as an actor in general but i mostly prefer him by much in action movies or stuff like The Thomas Crown affair, the bond series and After the sunset. Ive always felt he was a bitt out pf place in straight up rom coms but Some kind of beautiful was the exception and his performance in this movie was good as his Bondian characters and films out of the Bond series( The Thomas Crown affair and after the sunset). The whole cast is very good and it has a very nice story which is very funny at times and The chemistry between Salma and Pierce was great. Don't listen to the critics they only Rom Coms when they are with George Clooney, Jennifer Lawrence or Bradley Cooper. If you are someone like me who misses the 90s because of the Rom Coms pupularity this movie is for you."5,"I saw this movie last night in Santa Cruz CA. It was exactly what I needed for my soul after everything that is happening in the world. This movie is visually stunning, the story is captivating and the riders each add their uniqueness to the adventure. I didn't want it to end. I must say the stars of the film are the amazing horses (and donkey!) and the spectacular landscape that we are lucky enough to call home. Well done."5,Whether you are a horse owner/lover or not this is an outstanding film that you will thoroughly enjoy and should see.5,"This is a crazy little movie, regarding the devastation of the BEAUTIFUL mountains of Appalachia. Everyone needs to hve their eyes opened to crime against mother earth, This movie opened my eyes."5,"I loved the film. It's educational, fun, insightful, inspiring and I left the theatre with feeling like dancing!"5,A truly great film. A one of kind masterpiece. Highly recommended. It will haunt you for a long time. Great acting. Great story. One of the finest films I've ever seen.5,"One of the best documentaries of 2015. The film focuses on the televised debates of Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley during the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1968. Excellently put in the context of a time of great upheaval -- the rise of the new conservative movement, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and America's role as the global police were front and center. The film greatly explores how this series of televised debates became the ""dawn of punditry"" in current television. This gave birth to the two versions of America as seen by Conservatives and the Liberals, and how television became a medium not of reality, but of conflicting strong opinions repeated to us 24/7. Pacing was flawless, plenty of archival footage thoughtfully edited, and just simply entertaining."5,a hymn to the transcendent via music. Wonderful. A film to see again and again.5,"The sublime photography in black and white, complemented with a confused assembly, leaving a sense of timelessness that the director has no intention of changing. Even getting out of fiction to mock his own production and creative work. The movie is funny, surprising and fresh. It has sharp, ellipses and ironies cuts; plays with planes, shadows and sound. In short it is an ode to the life of the university, where the illusions, the surprises, the achievements and disappointments can happen in one day amid drunkenness and adventure without leaving the great Mexico City."5,"Hungry Hearts is a perfect gem, a true work of art. excellent in every possible way including performances, script, and art direction. Adam Driver's performance is his best ever."5,"The best Greek film that I have seen in ages! Panos Koutras is simply the great film director of his generation. Yiorgos Lanthimos got the Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination for his ""Dogtooth,"" but his formalism lacks any spirit, especially the spirit of a Greek. Koutras has lots of spirit, and then some! ""Xenia"" is in total sync with contemporary life in Greece."5,"An amazing journey through hope, darkness and triumph! A true tale of how love can make a fool of anyone and the dementia that it causes."5,"Excellent movie. I watched it because I read the book and I became interested on this topic, but the movie is 10 times better than the book. The lead roles are outstanding. That man is truly a monster and the girl makes you totally forget that she is not the real one. I am greatly impressed. Great film!"5,Had the opportunity to see this at a film festival early last year. As a former prep schooler of the 80's I had to see it. It was a great film with captivating actors. Thomas Mann played the role of a conflicted teen straddling to socioeconomic worlds struggling to hang on to one. He eventually goes over to the wrong side as he is pulled by the beauty of Lucy Fry. A must see!5,"I got to see this film at the Hamptons International Film Festival. So so GOOD! Brilliant direction, stunning cast. Can't wait to see it again! Definitely a must see."5,"2015 has been a terrific year for strong female characters and feminist stories. However, even with the competition, Carol manages to stand out. Terrific performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are heightened by excellent direction from Todd Haynes, who focuses more on visual storytelling here), and a wonderful screenplay that expresses the burden of ordinary lives for women. Women, even today, have been tied down by the fate of their male lovers and societal norms, and the movie expresses this with subtlety and class. Furthermore, it expresses that this is not a story about two lesbians falling in love; it's a story about two good people falling in love. That is the mindset that society needs to get to. That is what this movie is pushing for.Â What a message, and what a movie. Easily one of the best of 2015."5,"Beautifully directed and edited, with a stunning cinematography, a haunting score and two magnificent performances by Fassbender and Cotillard, this undeniably cinematic experience is a mesmerizing adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale of ambition, fear, guilt and madness."5,"Loved it! Barry was adorable, and was the perfect antidote to Jimmy's crassness. All in all, such a sweet story with a surprising underdog winner."5,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this film recently, and were in stiches the whole way through. Leads Tyler Labine, as Toph, and Chace Crawford, as Cooper, make a wonderful comedy duo, performing off of each other in a naturalistic manner. Directed by real-life brother Cameron Labine, the film centers around the bond of brothers. The relaxed dramedy makes excellent use of the epic Canadian landscape while exploring the emotional rapport that builds between the two brothers in the wake of their father's disappearance and death. Heartfelt, hilarious, and hard to look away from, it's one I recommend to everyone."5,"Clearly the best of the Live Musical adaptations that have been so popular lately. The massive sets, the inclusion of the audience in a lot of the scenes, and including seasoned broadway alums in the main cast really made a difference in this film. Hopefully the next Live attempt will be as good as this one was."5,Best Chinese Movie I have ever seen in 5 years5,"Unique and terrifying. You'll never feel alone again! And if your computer's camera isn't covered now, it will be after you see this film. Highly recommended."5,"Soulfully written, powerfully acted, gorgeously photographed and superbly directed! Loved it!"5,This is easily my favorite movie of 2015 and it ranks among my top 10 favorites of all time. This movie had everything I look for in a horror suspense movie. It was creepy with a very interesting story. Great acting and a great performance by young Jared Breeze as Ted made this movie worth it. I expect to see great things from Jared Breeze in the future. This is a must see.5,"Very enjoyable, inspiring movie. This is an amazing story that I found spellbinding."5,"excellent movie and a must see. passionate in her beliefs and going for what she knows was the right thing to do. it started with a dream and ended as it should have, with happiness and laughter."5,"Incredible, inspiring movie."5,One of the most breath-taking documentary films I've ever seen this year.5,"Still a great movie after over a decade. This shows that not all great movies have to have cursing, violence, or death."5,This was a great movie. Shows how people in high places in our goverment dont give a shit about what happens to gay community. Not till it hits the straight community5,"A delightfully, zany film and one of my personal favorite comedies of all time. A wonderful reminder of the glorious days of live television, the time is 1954 a young writer Benjy Stone, played terrifically by Mark Linn-Baker who works for TV's top show is given the job to chaperoning that week's guest star, a real skirt chaser with a big drinking problem who is notoriously unreliable, Alan Swann a legendary screen swashbuckler played by Peter O' Toole who is absolutely magnificent in comic tour-de-force performance. Stone must make sure that the tipsy Swann shows for rehearsals and the final production. Brilliant supporting performances Jessica Harper, Joseph Bologna, Bill Macy, Lainie Kazan, Anne De Salvo, Lou Jacobi, Apolph, Selma Diamond, Cameron Mitchell, and a smashing directorial debut by Richard Benjamin. Exquisite period detail and a intelligent screenplay, that is full of priceless moments and witty one liners. This is a heartfelt funny movie that works, thanks to the charisma and professionalism of it's star Peter O 'Toole. Highly Recommended."5,"Just saw Luchino Visconti's Il Gattopardo in a restored print at the George Eastman House this evening...my God, what an experience. Clocking in at just over 3 hours, this epic tale of the last years of a Sicilian Prince during the Garibaldi era. On the surface, it is the story of the end of an age"5,"One of my favorite films. If you like a good conspiracy/suspense movie, this is one of the best you'll see. Realistic to a scary degree, especially considering it came out just after the Kennedy assassination."5,"This movie actually made me a fan of Lynn and Cline. I really hadn't heard of them til I saw the movie. But, after I saw the movie, I was hooked."5,"Never mind the biographical inaccuracies. Those are minor quibbles. The heart of this movie is Gary Busey's engaging, stunning, Oscar-nomiated performance as Holly, singing with his own voice and playing guitar. An underrated gem."5,"I loved this movie! The acting was awesome, and Rudolph Valentino had such sex appeal...the way he looked at the other woman...so HOT!!!"5,"the best marx bros, musically. two harpo numbers, one magnificent chico number, some crazy black minstrel shit."5,"The film that got Suzuki fired is a perfect example of what happens when you let artistic freedom run free on a studio genre picture. This is teh equivalent of someone turning a formula action pic like Mr and Mrs. Smith, into an artistic achievement. Sure it's good for folks like me, but most audience members and studios like to get what they pay for, and it would bomb and there'd be hell to pay. Hats off to Suzuki for continuing to have a successful career after this amazing film."5,"If you ever thought Marilyn could not act, check out this film. Some of the beauty goddess' best work. She plays an unstable, suicidal babysitter who encounters a tough-minded, cynical airline pilot and causes him to change his outlook. You'll gain a whole new respect for Marilyn."5,"There are more worries in the life of a gangster besides money. There's love, loyalty, friendship, and the most implacable killer of all: time itself, the way it undermines and vanishes every human being no matter how strong or resolute he/she used to be. Jean Gabin plays the elegant and charismatic Max, an aging criminal mentor who finds his way to retirement full of bumps.Â After pulling out the heist that Max thought would end up his occupation for good, Max's best friend Riton tells his girlfriend (a very young Jeanne Moreau) about their last job. Unfortunately, this leak of information given by the incompetent Riton leads to his kidnapping by Max's competitor Angelo (Lino Ventura) who will demand their last job's loot for ransom. It will all be decided in a tense and masterfully shot gun battle. An engrossing masterpiece with phenomenal direction, acting and cinematography."5,"I loved this movie, Tracy is an innocent man fighting for his life, and everyone wants to kill him! It's so exciting and suspenseful. A must see."5,"Not only one of the most famous French films of all time, but also a definitive example of a film challenging its viewers to look beyond plot and character to discover its meaning. Utilizing 70mm to its full advantage, and truly clever sound design help propel Tati's masterpiece to ""must see"" status. You'll be hard pressed to find a better satirical statement on the effects of an impersonal, technologically advanced, but ultimately culturally bankrupt and dehumanized society. A perfect message for the times we live in."5,"Absolute favorite movie! I've seen this several years back, geez! I've forgotten this for a while, but I love it still!"5,There is something beyond hypnotic about this movie. It constantly feels dream like and almost nightmarish. The film centers on the chaos of the uprising on inhabitants of an island. The laugh of the one little old man is the best and when he gets a case of the giggles its gold. There is so much to dig in this movie5,"This is the finest Chaplin movie I have seen, and I think I've seen them all. It's sweet but dark, like human beings, and ultimately an ode to the ability of the human spirit to remain elevated in hard times--even when his cabin mate is hallucinating him as a chicken so he can eat him! The choreography in the individual scenes is forehead-smacking: when Big Jim and Black Bart (or whatever his name was) were fighting with a loaded rifle and the Little Fellows was in its sights, it was breathtaking. His dance with the rolls is a tour de force."5,"This is my favourite Hitckcock movie of the thirties, I think. It's the most like his later movies. It's exciting, suspenseful, and realistic, I love it."5,"There is enough symbolism here to keep a whole team of cinematic existentialists busy for months. At its core, it's a film about a man who gets trapped in a hole. Too simplistic? Probably. It's the story of an entomologist who gets captured by a group of villagers and is forced to shovel sand along side the beautiful Kyoko Kishida (I could think of far worse fates). He spends most of his waking hours plotting his escape, but the longer he's there the more he feels obligated to his hole-mate. Is he falling in love? Is he learning the meaning of true freedom? Can he figure out a way to escape? Does he really want to? Is he an 'everyman' and the hole a representation of an oppressive society? Can I find a clever way to end this review?"5,"Who cares if El Dorado has a similar to Rio Bravo, it's a great movie that is one of the best American Westerns. The story has such a beautiful flow and pace, with characters that you are glued to from the beginning. That's what Howard Hawks does best, create movies that people can enjoy and also respect. With a dynamite cast like The Duke, Robert Mitchum and James Caan, how can you lose? While this might be a lot more subtle, it shows you everything good about the genre and has absolutely zero flaws. You can appreciate it from every level, it's not for any one type of audience."5,"Generous helpings of drama, witty banter, and that powerful shade of romance that can only be explored in a time when innocence was key, and you had to work with hwat you had."5,"Without a doubt, one of the best films ever made. This is Paris in 1968 before Paris in 1968. This is punk rock before punk rock, and what The Clash meant by ""I wasn't born, so much as I fell out."" This is New Wave before New Wave. This is existentialism, Camus from the mouth of babes. This is what Foucault was going on about in Discipline and Punish. This is the non-conformist spirit, at once made concrete and abstract. This is how it feels to be dispossessed, displaced, and dispirited. This is the un-coming-of-age story, the moment of the invention of the precise opposite of the cliche. This is On The Waterfront for the French, but better. This is the loneliness at the core of human existence, communicated better than in most art made before or since. This is one of the few films I will gush about rather than ""objectively"" pick apart. This is brilliant, visionary film-making, and a movie you absolutely must not die without having seen."5,"Incredible cinema! This is why we love Carole Lombard, William Powell and screwball comedies."5,"I'm left here alone, wanting more... Rex felt this intensely so throughout the film... Damn, this film is something else. Better psychological thriller than ""The Butterfly Collector"", I certainly think that (and that one's one of my faves!). The slow pace of this film really works well for it. You piece things together as you watch, things click here and there, ideas float around... And it's all very enjoyable. It's a psychological thriller, you need to know this going in to fully enjoy it."5,Another great movie by Annemarie Jacir! This movie does a great job shinning the light on the perspective of a boy from a refugee camp in '67. Highly recommend this movie!5,"This is probably my most favorite movie, in all of its cuts. I do have the total series in both the dvd edition AND BluRay. The visuals and the back story content are enticingly magnetic; but of course I also feel strongly about the outstanding visuals and depth of Kramer's 2001 (both films produced some time before we became so 'hung' on CGI."5,"Very entertaining, in depth documentary. I miss the old mom & pop video stores."5,"A great flick that finally ties in the shrunken worlds being restored that are featured in several other DC blu rays...Im sure this movie will get a slightly negative review overall by most but aside from some poor voice choices this was a much better visual movie than elite's was and finally puts brainiac in HD and shows his original form...i may have went a different route with brainiacs voice as well as lois and maybe even the man of steel himself, but i loved this movie all around it was solid if u truely love comic looking and type movies.....it was gunna be hard to top apocalypse but they carried on the supergirl story well and still had plenty of other stuff going along with it that was awesome...a must see.."5,A great documentary. If you lived through the 60s and 70s or not this is a must see film. If you love radio you must see this film. Bob Fass is a true artist.5,"It is a near-flawless animated version of Frank Miller's classic tale from the late 80s that spawned the Tim Burton and latest incarnation of Batman. It's long overdue for this story to have been told, though I would have preferred a cinematic version. However, this animated version is reminiscent of the HBO Spawn series, which remains the most underrated animated series ever. Very well done. I look forward to part 2."5,"It's a testament to a very long road...but for those who are struggling for what we've taken for granted, it's got to start somewhere! Forge on--we're with you!"5,This documentary is brilliant! The macro filmed bee colonies just hypnotizes you and the contrast between types of honey production is amazing. Being Swiss myself it just gave me some thrill to go up the mountains an meet these beekeepers. This is truly very insightful and everybody should watch it. A must see for sure!!!5,This is a great documentary. It has all my favorite classic TV writers in one place. I'm glad someone was clever enough to make this film. I really enjoyed it.5,"Beautiful and delicious film, follows rare fruit lovers all over the world in their quest to preserve varieties of rare fruit all over the world, and try to create community fruit orchards."5,"A very interesting film about one of rocks most intriguing bands. Rush is one of the most powerful power trios in rock history and this film is the inside story about that band. Featuring interviews with prominent rock and heavy metal musicians, this is a very well put together documentary by the guys who brought us Metal: A headbanger's Journey, Global Metal, Iron Maiden: Flight 666. This film will delight the diehard Rush fan as much as any other fan of Rock and heavy metal music. A terrific documentary, this is the definite look into one of Canada's greatest bands."5,"Having grown up with Batman: The Animated Series, and of course that awful Batman and Robin flick from the 90's, I wasn't sure what was in store. Happily, I report that this straight to video animated accessory to the Batman comic books is one of the most adult spectacular of animated superstardom I have ever seen. This ain't yours or your parent's Batman. This is closer to The Dark Knight than campy Adam West classics of the 60's. You've got gratuitous violence, drugs, and even a single and yet dramatic swear word. Oh yes, and there's more folks! On top of the awesomeness that is Batman, the film actually stays true to the comics ranging all the way back the fifties, and the more recent Under the Hood edition from 2005. The voice acting was well cast and essentially served a great purpose. Don't be freaked by the gruff voiced Joker, because though you can only hear the tried and true voice in that ridiculous clown laugh of his, his murder sprees become more believable when a low tone is hanging over the events like a black cloud of death. So many oohs and aahs, I only have high praise for this DC art form."5,"Don't let the subject turn you away. Here is a movie that makes you understand the impact of the genocide in Rwanda without, (miraculously and masterfully) resorting to depiction of graphic violence. Instead, it weaves an intricate web of tender human interactions and decision points which define each character in terms of levels of humanity. This quietly powerful film would stay with you for a long time."5,"This is a story of an unjust system, looking only to protect its own neck. This is the outrage of onlookers and commentators who cannot stand the ridiculous logic behind taking a man's life away when he did not commit any wrong. Most of all, this is one young man's brave fight to show the world that he can be beaten down, but not beaten. The story is reminiscent of Mumia Abu Jamal's own plight, except the circumstances of Paco's innocence are more blatant and apparent."5,"Beautiful, heartbreaking, thought-provoking--all things that a documentary addressing this topic should be."5,"An important and engaging documentary about the unimaginable horrors of the early years of AIDS. Although I had head some of this before from older friends, it provided a much better, more complete account of a harrowing time. It is easy to forget the pain and fears of others, or just to know them in a detached academic way. We should never forget that an entire community dying was reality for some people."5,"Paddy Chavefsky's script is a joy in this seemingly simple tale about two ""ugly""people finding safe harbor in each other (there's even a hilarious minor side trip that critiques popular detective author Mickey Spillane!). Great performances throughout."5,"Paul Newman was captivating and so in control with his character. Diane Cilento played off of him really well. Martin Balsum & Richard Boone all were good. This film had a haunting sort of flavor to it...probably because of the SW desert and the independence of Paul Newman's character John Russell. To me, one of Newman's best films right up there with Cool Hand Luke."5,"You won't dare open your mouth, but you'll be screaming for her to escape! And the weird thing the Idea fascinated me."5,Barbara Stanwyck exudes enough sexuality to spark a fence post. I don't think I've ever seen a film with such perfect casting. Hilarious and brilliant.5,"When this film came out 50 years ago, it was cursed by the audience's growing lack of interest in epic films. It may have been doomed in the box office, but it was a great film, and I feel it deserves to be mentioned alongside the various other great films. The characters are all played incredibly well, and their performance goes great with some interesting lines and amazing speeches. It might be impossible for me to judge whether or not the film is historically accurate (because I'm not a history buff), but the story is very engaging, which is helped by the stellar performance of the film's cast. The film looks great, with numerous amazing set pieces, costumes, and beautiful locations. The film's pace is slow, but it leads to a satisfying conclusion, and when the action happens, it flows very well. In summary, it's a classic movie that didn't get as much attention as it should have when it was new. If you haven't seen it, then I suggest that you go see it, if you can handle the film's three-hour length."5,"Dead Ringer is a superb film and I think it is not only one of the most underrated Bette Davis films, but also one of her very best. I found it to be a gripping and thoroughly compelling suspense film that wouldn't let me go until it was finished due mostly to Bette Davis's absolutely stunning performances playing twin sisters. The film also has many surprises up its sleeve as the plot unfolds and dark secrets are revealed. This is one of the most underrated films ever and it deserves a lot more attention because it is an amazing film, in my opinion."5,As great as it is sad. A story of real heroes versus the crazy world they lived in.5,"An excellent love story! Yash Chopra is a great director. Fascinating story plot. Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, Shahrukh Khan, and Amitabh Bachchan are all phenomenal in this. Great music!"5,this IS the love story of ALL times!!!! the love that they had for each other is unimaginable!!!!! unheared of!! so deep!!! AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!!!!!!5,"A masterful exercise in suspense from the decorated Fritz Lang, concerning a child murderer (Peter Lorre) and how his killing spree angers not only the families of those who are slain, but the underbelly society of criminals and thugs who want him off of the street as well for their own personal reasons. In terms of influence and memorability, this film fully surpasses Lang's previous effort ""Metropolis"", a good but not great film which had an extremely corny ending I could not for one overlook among other problems. This is a polar opposite to that movie. It focuses on a nihilistic society where nobody trusts anyone, and the motives of those involved never seem to be pure and noble. Lorre's monstrous, unforgettably arresting performance really anchors this film, which builds to a devastating conclusion in which those who are hurt the most get to utter the overall message and haunting final words of the film. A phenomenal classic that can not go unwatched."5,"It surpasses the book and not only that,the freedom and liberality of this picture is breathtaking to the core,rising the sensual adrenaline where it needs to be risen.The other half is an introspective of social dualities.Bonham Carter,Maggie Smith,Sands,Elliott,too many performers,the best from Ivory-Merchant collaborations."5,"One of the best american comedies ever, this is an ageless film because it's still really hilarious, crazy and the story looks current. Fantastic from the beginning to the end."5,"The script is spectacular. And there's just so much acting to appreciate in this film, especially Bette Davis's snarky, proud, self-indulgent and insecure diva who gradually coaxes forth a full-on tempestuous storm, a ""hysterical screaming harpy"". This was my first introduction to Ms Davis, and though I'd never want to cross swords with her, I want more. I loved her and Merrill, they were romantically adorable! Bonus: a resplendent, bright-eyed Marilyn Monroe with a naughty smile as she shimmies out of her white fur coat to go sweet-talk a producer."5,I love film noir and this is a good one. First role for Kirk Douglas and he does look young in it. Great role for Barbara Stanwyk too. Melodramatic but dark too. Noir is always fun.5,"One of the most fun and exciting movie experiences I've had, The African Queen is another masterwork by Huston and Bogart."5,"Really, there's one word in the film-making vocabulary that explains this movie: pacing. Among the founding texts of the noir genre with crackling dialogue and a winding plot, the story's complemented by the steady Dana Andrews and the enchanting Gene Tierney in the title role. You'll be guessing until the end, and it's a roller-coaster the whole way. A can't-miss classic!"
