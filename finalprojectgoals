Final Project Goals â€“ Applied Statistical Programming 


What we have done:

Created package for sentimentIt that runs functions that do the following:

-	Create certifications and revoke them for workers for sentimentIt.
- Create unit tests for functions.
- Track hits from the batches.
- Randomly creates pairs of documents to be reviewed by workers.
- Assign new certifications to workers and assign them to the banned list if they are not up to par.
- Create higher level functions to use
-	Reads text from documents 
- Use these functionalities in STAN.


Goals for end:

- Have to create HITS based on progress in batch status.
- Creates wrappers for different functions in sentimentIt package.

SentimentIT Summary
Our goal is to create an R package that interacts with the SentimentIt API. Our functions help 
automate many of the elements of the API so researchers can easily interact with the API through R. The basic functions 
do simple tasks like creating HITS, posting documents to the API, reading in data from the API, checking workers, and
revoking worker qualifications. These functions are then put into a series of wrappers which offer the user different
levels of automation. Some levels allow the user to time when batches are posted, and the final wrapper SentimentIt 
automates the entire process from start to finish.
