Taishi - 
    - you have a stand alone folder - integrate your functions into the main R folder
    - document your functions, create unit tests for each function
    - the functions I want:
        - fit_stan: take in a csv od batch numbers and fit the data, return a stan fit object
            - if the input is a vector of batches grab the data using the readInData function
        - check_workers: take in a stan fit and return workers that are low outliers and have answered more than 100
            - take an argument plot that is defaulted to FALSE but if set to TRUE will create a histogram with a rug plot
            - take an optional argument file that will save the histogram to the path and file name specified
        - fit_stan_heir: same as fit_stan but heirarchical
        - stanWrapper: create a function that will call either fit_stan or fit_stan_heir and will call check_workers
            - it should return a fit object if an argument returnFit is TRUE, workers that are outliers, optionally plot the histogram, optionally save the histogram
    - all of this should be done by next Thursday

Others - 
    - document all functions created and create minimal tests (when appropriate -- just don't create tests that will charge us)
    1st:
        - create a function to certify workers
        - create a function to revoke certifications
            - the return should be a boolean, indicating success or failure
        - create a function that will take two certifications as arguments and a vector of worker IDs -- the function will remove workers from the first certification and add them to the second
            - this should utilize the other two functions
            - the idea is we will use this to revoke certifications and add them to the banned list
